The battery swap process can take as little as three minutes, depending on the station and the vehicle. The swapped battery is then recharged at the station and ready for another use.

Battery swapping requires EVs to have standardized and swappable batteries that can be easily removed and installed by robots or humans. The batteries are usually leased or rented by the EV owners, who pay a monthly fee or per swap fee for the service. The batteries are owned and maintained by the service provider, who also operates the swap stations.

Battery swapping is not a new concept, as it was first proposed by Better Place, an Israeli startup that went bankrupt in 2013. However, some companies have revived the idea and implemented it successfully in some markets. One of them is Nio, a Chinese EV maker that offers battery swapping as a service for its models. Nio has built over 1100 swap stations in China and Europe.
