## Connector types

A way to classify charging ports is by their charging connector, which is the physical shape and size of the plug that connects the EV to the charging station. Different types of charging connectors vary by region, standard, and compatibility.

### J1772

J1772 is the standard Level 1 and Level 2 charging connector for all American EVs except Teslas. It was created by the [Society of Automotive Engineers](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j1772_201710/) (SAE) and works with any Level 1 or Level 2 charger in the US. It has a round shape with five pins and a latch. It can deliver up to 19.2 kW of power.

### Type 2

Type 2 is the standard Level 2 charging connector for European EVs. It was created by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and works with any Level 1 or Level 2 charger in Europe. It has a round shape with seven pins and a latch. It can deliver up to 43 kW of power.

### CCS

This is the standard Level 3 charging connector for all EVS in Europe and most brands in America.

It stands for Combined Charging System and was created by a [CharIN consortium](https://www.charin.global/) of automakers and standards organizations.

It comes in two versions

#### CCS Combo 1

It has a round shape with two additional DC pins below the J1772 connector. It can deliver up to 350 kW of power with a maximum of 920 Volts. It is used in North America.

#### CCS Combo 2

It has a round shape with two additional DC pins below the type 2 connector. It can deliver up to 350 kW of power with a maximum of 920 Volts. This version is used in Europe on all brands.

### NACS (Tesla)

NACS, or The [North American Charging Standard](https://www.tesla.com/blog/opening-north-american-charging-standard), is the Tesla Connector that Tesla opened for others in 2022.

NACS is the proprietary Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 charging connector for all Tesla EVs sold in North America. Tesla created it, and it works only with Tesla chargers, such as the Supercharger or Destination Charger networks. It has a rectangular shape with two pins and a button.

The [standard](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/HXVNIC_North_American_Charging_Standard_Technical_Specification_TS-0023666_HFTPKZ.pdf) says it can deliver up to 250 kW of power with a maximum of 1000 Volts. Ford [announced](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2023/05/25/ford-ev-customers-to-gain-access-to-12-000-tesla-superchargers--.html) May 25. 2023, they will add a NACS port on their models from 2024 in North America.

NACS is smaller and lighter than CCS Combo 1, which makes it easier to handle and plug in.

### CHAdeMO

CHAdeMO is the standard Level 3 charging connector for most Japanese EVs, such as Nissan, Mitsubishi, and Toyota. It stood for CHArge de MOve and was created by a consortium of Japanese companies and organizations. It is round, with two large DC pins and two small communication pins. It can deliver up to 62.5 kW of power.

## Charge port location

EVs have different locations for their charge port. Here are the most common

### Rear corner

This is a very common location since all Tesla models have this location.
