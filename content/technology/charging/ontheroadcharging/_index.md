 It uses a high-power DC current that can deliver up to 480 volts and 100 amps. High speed charging can add up to 200 miles of range in just 20 to 30 minutes of charging, which means it can quickly replenish an EV battery for long-distance driving. High speed charging is suitable for highway or public charging, or for EVs with large batteries and high range.

However, high speed charging also has some challenges that need to be addressed. Here are some of them:

Compatibility: Not all EVs and chargers are compatible with high speed charging. You need to have an EV model that supports high speed charging, a charger that can handle high speed power flow, and a connector that can communicate high speed signals. You also need to have a smart meter and a smart grid that can enable high speed transactions and services.
Cost: High speed charging may require additional hardware and software components that can increase the cost of your EV and charger. You may also need to pay for installation, maintenance, and subscription fees for high speed services. You may also face additional taxes, tariffs, or regulations that can affect the profitability of high speed charging.
Degradation: High speed charging may increase the degradation of your EV battery due to more frequent and deeper cycles of charging and discharging. This may reduce the lifespan and performance of your EV battery and increase the risk of failure or safety issues. You may need to monitor your EV battery health and condition and follow best practices to minimize degradation.

## Most common charging networks by location

### USA

There are several charging networks in the US for EVs. According to the US Department of Energy, Tesla has over **1,600 Supercharger stations** in the US, with over **17,000 fast-charging ports**. Electrify America is next in line, with about **800 stations**.

Here are some of the largest EV charging networks in the US:

- Electrify America: The largest DC fast charging network for the majority of EV models. They're open to all EVs with a CCS charging connection (the industry standard) and, for the time being, the few vehicles that still use CHAdeMO like the Nissan Leaf¹.

- Tesla Superchargers: Tesla's Supercharger network is the largest in the country, with less distance between stations compared to Electrify America¹.

- EVgo: DC fast charging isn't limited to road trips. EVgo has over **800 fast charging locations** across 34 states and more than 65 metropolitan areas.

- ChargePoint: ChargePoint has over **115,000 charging spots** across North America and Europe¹.

- Blink: Blink has over **15,000 charging stations** across 30 states.

### Europe

There are several charging networks in Europe for EVs. Here are some of the largest EV charging networks in Europe:

- Ionity: A high-power charging station network for EVs that enables long-distance travel across Europe. It was founded as a joint venture by the BMW Group, Mercedes-Benz Group, Ford Motor Company, and Volkswagen Group².

- Plugsurfing: A European-wide network you could use for charging an EV in Europe. With its unique key or card – which costs €9.95 – and its free smartphone app, you can use upwards of 200,000 chargers, including those from different networks such as Allego, EnBW, Eon, Innogy, IONITY and Vattenfall¹.

- Maingau: Through its EinfachStromLaden smartphone app, charging chip or card, you can charge an EV in Germany, Austria or Switzerland at 50,000 charging points with Maingau.
