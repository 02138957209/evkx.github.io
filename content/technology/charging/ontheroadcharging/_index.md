 It uses a high-power DC current that can deliver up to 480 volts and 100 amps. High speed charging can add up to 200 miles of range in just 20 to 30 minutes of charging, which means it can quickly replenish an EV battery for long-distance driving. High speed charging is suitable for highway or public charging, or for EVs with large batteries and high range.

However, high speed charging also has some challenges that need to be addressed. Here are some of them:

Compatibility: Not all EVs and chargers are compatible with high speed charging. You need to have an EV model that supports high speed charging, a charger that can handle high speed power flow, and a connector that can communicate high speed signals. You also need to have a smart meter and a smart grid that can enable high speed transactions and services.
Cost: High speed charging may require additional hardware and software components that can increase the cost of your EV and charger. You may also need to pay for installation, maintenance, and subscription fees for high speed services. You may also face additional taxes, tariffs, or regulations that can affect the profitability of high speed charging.
Degradation: High speed charging may increase the degradation of your EV battery due to more frequent and deeper cycles of charging and discharging. This may reduce the lifespan and performance of your EV battery and increase the risk of failure or safety issues. You may need to monitor your EV battery health and condition and follow best practices to minimize degradation.
