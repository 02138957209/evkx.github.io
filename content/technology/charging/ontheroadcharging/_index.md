It uses a high-power DC current that can deliver up to 1000 volts and 100 amps. High speed charging can add up to 200 miles of range in just 20 to 30 minutes of charging, which means it can quickly replenish an EV battery for long-distance driving. High speed charging is suitable for highway or public charging, or for EVs with large batteries and high range.


## Most common charging networks by location

### USA

There are several charging networks in the US for EVs. According to the US Department of Energy, Tesla has over **1,600 Supercharger stations** in the US, with over **17,000 fast-charging ports**. Electrify America is next in line, with about **800 stations**.

Here are some of the largest EV charging networks in the US:

- [Electrify America](https://www.electrifyamerica.com/): The largest DC fast charging network for the majority of EV models. They're open to all EVs with a CCS charging connection (the industry standard) and, for the time being, the few vehicles that still use CHAdeMO like the Nissan Leaf.
