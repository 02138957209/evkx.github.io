It allows you to charge your EV overnight or whenever you are not using it, without having to worry about finding a public charging station. 

Home charging can also reduces the stress on the grid by using off-peak electricity.

However, home charging also has some challenges. Not all homes have access to a dedicated parking space or a suitable electrical outlet for charging an EV. 

Installing a home charger may require permits, inspections, and professional services that can add to the cost and time. Home chargers also have different output capabilities and compatibility issues depending on the type of EV you have. 

Moreover, home charging may not be enough for long-distance trips or frequent driving that exceed the range of your EV.

## The Installation and Maintenance of Home Chargers

Installing a home charger may require some planning and preparation, depending on the type of charger you choose and the electrical capacity of your home. Here are some steps to follow:

### Install a hardwired charging stations

Many EVs comes with an emergency charging stations to be used when you dont have other options. These ar typical equipped with a plug to connect. Using this as a standard charging equipment at home have an increased fire risk and should be avoided if possible. 


## Choose the best location for your home charger, preferably near your parking space and close to an electrical panel.

Choose the best type of charger for your EV model, driving habits, and budget. Consider the output level, connector type, cord length, installation options, features, warranty, and price.

Check the electrical requirements of your chosen charger and compare them with the existing wiring and circuit breaker in your home. You may need to upgrade your electrical panel or install a new dedicated circuit for your charger.

Hire a licensed electrician to install your home charger according to the local codes and regulations. You may also need to obtain permits and inspections from your utility company or municipality before or after the installation.

Test your home charger and make sure it works properly and safely with your EV. You may also need to register your home charger with the manufacturer or the utility company to activate its features or receive incentives.

Maintain your home charger by keeping it clean, dry, and protected from extreme weather and physical damage. You may also need to update its software or firmware periodically to ensure its optimal performance and compatibility.

## The Cost and Efficiency of Home Charging

Home charging is generally cheaper and more efficient than public charging, but the exact cost and efficiency may vary depending on several factors. Here are some factors to consider:

The electricity rate in your area and the time of day you charge. Electricity rates may vary by region, season, and time of day. You may pay more for electricity during peak hours (usually in the afternoon or evening) than off-peak hours (usually at night or early morning).

You may also pay more for electricity in summer than in winter. You can check your electricity bill or contact your utility company to find out the exact rate you pay for electricity.

## The output level and efficiency of your home charger

Higher output levels may charge your EV faster, but they may also consume more electricity and generate more heat and losses. Lower output levels may charge your EV slower, but they may also consume less electricity and generate less heat and losses. The efficiency of your home charger may depend on its quality, design, and features. You can check the specifications or reviews of your home charger to find out its output level and efficiency.

The battery capacity and state of charge of your EV. Larger batteries may take longer and cost more to charge than smaller batteries. The state of charge of your battery may affect how fast and how much it can accept a charge. Batteries tend to charge faster when they are low on charge and slower when they are high on charge. Batteries also tend to lose some charge over time due to self-discharge or parasitic loads. You can check the dashboard or app of your EV to find out its battery capacity and state of charge.

The driving range and efficiency of your EV. Longer driving range may require more energy and cost more to charge than shorter driving range. The driving range of your EV may depend on its battery capacity, driving habits, weather conditions, and vehicle features. The driving efficiency of your EV may depend on its aerodynamics, weight, tires, regenerative braking, and vehicle modes. You can check the EPA rating or real-world tests of your EV to find out its driving range and efficiency.

## Country specific home charging info

### USA

For home charging in USA there are two levels.

• Level 1 (120 volt): This is the standard household outlet that you can plug your EV into with a cord provided by the automaker. It provides about 5 miles of range per hour of charging and does not require any additional equipment or installation. This option is suitable for people who drive less than 50 miles a day or have access to public or workplace chargers..

•  Level 2 (240 volt): This is a faster and more powerful option that requires a special charger and a 240V outlet, similar to the ones used for electric clothes dryers. It provides about 25 miles of range per hour of charging and may need an electrician to install the charger and outlet. This option is suitable for people who drive more miles a day or need to charge their EVs quickly at home.

There are also some safety rules and regulations that you should follow when installing and using home chargers for EVs. For example, the NEC 80% rule stipulates that for EV charging, electrical circuits should not be continuously loaded to more than 80% of their maximum rated capacity. This means that you should choose a charger that matches the capacity of your circuit breaker and outlet. For example, if you have a 40-amp circuit breaker and a 240V outlet, you should use a 32-amp charger (80% of 40 amps) or lower.

Another rule that may affect your home charging options is the US buildin codes. The changes specifically call for all new homes built in the US to be "EV ready". Basically, the electrical infrastructure for EVs will be as common as a 240V outlet for home appliances. This means that if you are buying or building a new home in the US, you may already have access to Level 2 charging without any additional installation or cost.
