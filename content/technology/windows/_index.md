Windows in cars can be classified into different types according to their location, function and design. In this article, we will explore the main types of windows in cars, their features and benefits, and some tips on how to maintain them.

## Windshield

The windshield is the front window of the car that covers the entire width of the vehicle. It is made of laminated glass, which consists of two layers of glass bonded together by a plastic interlayer. This type of glass is designed to withstand high impact and prevent shattering into sharp pieces in case of a collision. The windshield also protects the occupants from wind, rain, dust, insects and other debris that may fly into the car.

The windshield may have some additional features, such as:

- Heating coils or wires embedded in the glass to defrost or defog the windshield in cold or humid conditions.
- Antennae for radio, GPS or other communication systems integrated into the glass.
- Tinting or coating to reduce glare, heat or UV rays from the sun.
- Sensors or cameras for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) such as lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control or automatic braking.

The windshield is one of the most important safety components of a car, as it contributes to the structural integrity and stability of the vehicle. According to Wikipedia, the windshield absorbs 45% of the impact force in a head-on collision and 60% of the impact force in a rollover accident. The windshield also supports the deployment of airbags and prevents the occupants from being ejected from the car in case of a crash.

## Side Windows

Side windows are the windows on each side of the car, usually located on the doors. They are made of tempered glass, which is a type of glass that is heated and cooled rapidly to increase its strength and resistance to thermal shock. Tempered glass breaks into small, rounded pieces when shattered, which reduces the risk of injury to the occupants.

Side windows can be either fixed or movable. Fixed side windows are permanently attached to the car frame and cannot be opened or closed. Movable side windows can be raised or lowered by using a button, a switch or a hand crank. Movable side windows allow for ventilation, communication and access to the outside of the car.

Some side windows may have some additional features, such as:

- Tinting or coating to reduce glare, heat or UV rays from the sun.
- Electric motors or regulators to control the movement of the windows.
- Safety locks or child locks to prevent unauthorized opening or closing of the windows.
- Anti-pinch sensors or mechanisms to prevent injuries caused by trapping fingers or objects in the windows.

## Rear Window

The rear window is the window at the back of the car that covers most of the width of the vehicle. It is made of tempered glass, similar to side windows. The rear window provides visibility to the rear of the car and allows for rearward illumination by brake lights and reverse lights.

The rear window may have some additional features, such as:

- Heating coils or wires embedded in the glass to defrost or defog the rear window in cold or humid conditions.
- Antennae for radio, GPS or other communication systems integrated into the glass.
- Tinting or coating to reduce glare, heat or UV rays from the sun.
- Wiper blades or washers to clean the rear window from dirt or moisture.

The rear window is also an important safety component of a car,
as it helps the driver to see the traffic and obstacles behind the car and avoid collisions. The rear window also prevents the occupants from being ejected from the car in case of a crash.

Conclusion

Windows in cars are essential for visibility, ventilation, protection and comfort. They can be classified into different types according to their location, function and design. Each type of window has its own features and benefits, as well as its own maintenance requirements. By knowing the different types of windows in cars, their characteristics and importance, you can make an informed decision when choosing, using or repairing them
