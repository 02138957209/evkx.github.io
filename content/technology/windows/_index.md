Windows in cars can be classified into different types according to their location, function and design. In this article, we will explore the main types of windows in cars, their features and benefits, and some tips on how to maintain them.

## Windshield

The windshield is the front window of the car that covers the entire width of the vehicle. It is made of laminated glass, which consists of two layers of glass bonded together by a plastic interlayer. This type of glass is designed to withstand high impact and prevent shattering into sharp pieces in case of a collision. The windshield also protects the occupants from wind, rain, dust, insects and other debris that may fly into the car.

### Wipers

Windshield wipers are devices that remove rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, water, or debris from a vehicle's front window. They are powered by an electric motor and have a metal arm with a rubber blade attached to it. The blade swings back and forth over the glass, pushing away anything that might obstruct the driver's vision. 

Most EVs have two wipers but large evs like Hummer EV have three. 

The speed of the wipers can be adjusted, and some vehicles also have a windscreen washer system that sprays water or antifreeze fluid to help clean the glass. 


### Heating

## Side Windows

Side windows are the windows on each side of the car, usually located on the doors. They are made of tempered glass, which is a type of glass that is heated and cooled rapidly to increase its strength and resistance to thermal shock. Tempered glass breaks into small, rounded pieces when shattered, which reduces the risk of injury to the occupants.

Side windows can be either fixed or movable. Fixed side windows are permanently attached to the car frame and cannot be opened or closed. Movable side windows can be raised or lowered by using a button, a switch or a hand crank.

Some side windows may have some additional features, such as:

- Tinting or coating to reduce glare, heat or UV rays from the sun.
- Electric motors or regulators to control the movement of the windows.
- Safety locks or child locks to prevent unauthorized opening or closing of the windows.
- Anti-pinch sensors or mechanisms to prevent injuries caused by trapping fingers or objects in the windows.

## Rear Window

The rear window is the window at the back of the car that covers most of the width of the vehicle. It is made of tempered glass, similar to side windows. The rear window provides visibility to the rear of the car.

It is not required to have a rear window. Several models does not have a rear window, and some have replaced it with a camera.

The rear window may have some additional features, such as:

- Heating coils or wires embedded in the glass to defrost or defog the rear window in cold or humid conditions.
- Antennae for radio, GPS or other communication systems integrated into the glass.
- Tinting or coating to reduce glare, heat or UV rays from the sun.
- Wiper blades or washers to clean the rear window from dirt or moisture.

The rear window is also an important safety component of a car,
as it helps the driver to see the traffic and obstacles behind the car and avoid collisions. The rear window also prevents the occupants from being ejected from the car in case of a crash.




## Glass types

### Heat insulated glass

Windshields made of insulating glass have a transparent metallic infrared-reflecting coating.

### Noise insulated glass

For drivers, outside noise is most noticeable when entering a highway tunnel, where the concrete walls reflect sound into the carâ€™s interior.
Some manufacturers offers noise-insulated glass as a standard or optional feature. 

Unlike the conventional single-layer safety glass used for the sides and rear, this glass features five layers: glass, three layers of film, and then glass again. The middle layer of the three polyvinyl butyral (PVB) films has special acoustic properties that absorb much of the oscillation of the surrounding glass.

### Privacy glass

Privacy glass on cars is a type of glass that has been darkened at the factory by the car manufacturer. It is also known as factory tint. It is different from window tint, which is a film that is applied to the glass after it is manufactured. Privacy glass is usually used for the rear and side windows of the car, while the front windows and windshield have clear glass.

The main benefit of privacy glass is to provide more privacy for the passengers and the items inside the car. It can also help to reduce glare, deter crime, and keep the car cooler by blocking some of the sun's rays. However, privacy glass does not have high heat rejection or UV protection properties, unlike some window films. Privacy glass also cannot be removed, unless the glass itself is replaced.
