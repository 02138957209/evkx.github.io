By converting the vehicle’s kinetic energy into electrical energy and storing it in the battery, regenerative braking can extend the vehicle’s range and improve overall efficiency. This article will explore the different types of regenerative braking strategies used in EVs, their benefits, and their limitations.

## How does it work?

Regenerative braking is a process where the kinetic energy of a moving vehicle is captured and stored as electrical energy in the vehicle’s battery during braking or deceleration.

An electric motor can work as a generator in an EV by using the principle of electromagnetic induction, which states that the change in the magnetic field around a conductor generates an electric current in the circuit. When an electric motor rotates, it creates a magnetic field that interacts with the stator windings and produces an electric current that powers the vehicle. When the car decelerates or brakes, the wheels drive the motor in reverse, causing the magnetic field to change direction and induce electric current in the opposite direction. This current can be fed back to the battery and stored as energy, reducing the need for conventional friction brakes and increasing the range and efficiency of the EV.

## Types of Regenerative Braking Strategies

The EV manufacturers provide regenerative braking with different strategies. There are three main types of regen strategy. Some manufacturers only give one possibility, while others let the driver choose between two or all three.

### One-Pedal Driving

One pedal regen is a feature of some electric vehicles that allows them to control the acceleration and deceleration of the car with only the accelerator pedal. 

When the driver presses the pedal, the vehicle accelerates normally. When the driver releases the pedal, the car decelerates using regenerative braking, which converts the vehicle's kinetic energy into electrical energy that the EV stores in the battery.

Depending on the vehicle settings and driving conditions, one pedal regen can bring the vehicle to a complete stop or maintain a low speed until the driver presses the pedal again.

The benefit of one-pedal driving is that you only need to use one pedal.

The cons of one-pedal regen are that it can require some adaptation from drivers who are used to conventional two-pedal driving. In addition, it can vary in performance depending on factors such as battery state of charge, temperature, road gradient, and traffic flow.

While some EVs have fixed level on regen for one pedal driving other EVs have paddles on the steering wheel to active regen on different levels.




### Manual regen using brake pedal

On evs with blended brakes you can regenerate energy with pressing the brake pedal.

Regen using blended brake system in EVs works by using sensors and algorithms to determine the optimal balance between regenerative braking and friction braking, depending on factors such as driver input, battery state of charge, road conditions, traffic situation and vehicle speed. 

The system can also work with driver assistance systems such as adaptive cruise control or collision avoidance to enhance safety and convenience.

### Adaptive regen

Adaptive regen is a feature of some electric vehicles that allows them to adjust the level of regenerative braking according to the driving situation. Regenerative braking is a process that converts the kinetic energy of the vehicle into electrical energy that can be stored in the battery, reducing the need for using the conventional friction brakes and increasing the range and efficiency of the EV.

Adaptive regen works by using sensors, cameras and navigation data to detect the traffic conditions, road curvature, speed limits and other factors that affect the optimal deceleration rate of the vehicle. Based on this information, the system can automatically increase or decrease the regen level when the driver releases the accelerator pedal, without requiring manual input or mode selection.

The benefit of adaptive regen is that it can provide a smoother and more natural driving experience, as well as a more effective energy recovery. By adjusting the regen level according to the situation, adaptive regen can avoid excessive or insufficient braking that might cause discomfort or waste energy. Adaptive regen can also work with the driver assistance systems to enhance safety and convenience, such as maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle ahead or slowing down for a sharp turn.

Some examples of EVs that offer adaptive regen are the Porsche Taycan, the BMW i4 and the Hyundai Ioniq 5. These EVs use different technologies and algorithms to implement adaptive regen, but they all aim to provide a better one-pedal driving experience for their drivers.

## Max Regenerative Braking Power

Typical the max regenertive power will be between 100-300kW.

## Benefits of Regenerative Braking

There are several benefits to regenerative braking, including:

Improved Efficiency: By recovering energy during braking and deceleration, regenerative braking can extend the vehicle's range and improve its overall efficiency.

Reduced Wear on Brakes: Because regenerative braking can handle much of the vehicle's braking force, it can reduce wear on the vehicle's mechanical brakes, leading to lower maintenance costs.

Smoother Braking: Regenerative braking can provide smoother and more consistent braking compared to traditional friction brakes, leading to a more comfortable ride for passengers.

## Limitations of Regenerative Braking

While regenerative braking offers many benefits, there are some limitations to the technology. These include:

**Reduced Effectiveness at High Speeds:** Regenerative braking is less effective at high speeds, as the amount of kinetic energy that can be captured and stored decreases as the vehicle's speed increases.

**Limited Range Extension:** Regenerative braking can extend the vehicle's range, but the amount of energy that can be recovered is limited, and the overall impact on range can vary depending on driving conditions.

**Reduced Brake Feel:** Because regenerative braking uses the electric motor to slow the vehicle, it can reduce the feel of the brake pedal, making it less intuitive for some drivers.
