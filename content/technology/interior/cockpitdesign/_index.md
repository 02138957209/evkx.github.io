There are several types of center console designs that are commonly used in car cockpits. These include:

Traditional center console: This is the most common type of center console design, which features a box-shaped unit located between the driver and front passenger seats. It typically includes storage compartments, cup holders, and various controls for the car's audio and climate control systems.

Floating center console: This design is becoming increasingly popular in modern cars, especially those with a more futuristic or high-tech aesthetic. A floating center console is not attached to the floor or dash, but rather appears to hover above the transmission tunnel. It often includes touchscreens and other advanced features.

Minimalist center console: This design emphasizes simplicity and clean lines, and typically features a narrow, unobtrusive center console that may include only a few basic controls and storage compartments.

Split-level center console: This design features a two-tiered console, with a lower section for storage and cup holders, and an upper section that houses the car's audio and climate control systems.

Integrated center console: This type of center console is seamlessly integrated into the car's dashboard or instrument panel, and may feature touchscreens or other advanced features that are fully integrated into the car's overall design.

The type of center console design used in a car cockpit depends on various factors, such as the car's style, intended use, and target market.
