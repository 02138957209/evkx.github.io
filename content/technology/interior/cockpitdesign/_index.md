In this section, we will explore the cockpit design of today's EVs.

## Dashboard design and layout

The design and layout of the dashboard are essential for the driver experience. Here are the most common forms of the dashboard.

### Fully integrated screens

In this dashboard design, the manufacturer has fully integrated the screens and controls in the dashboard. Therefore, this design is typical of the one with the most upscale feel.

### Multiple non-integrated screens

Mounting the screens on top of the dashboard without integrating them is a common way to keep costs down. However, it often feels like the manufacturer forgot about the screens when designing the dashboard or that the screens are aftermarket.

### Minimalistic with a single non-integrated screen

This design includes a typical low dashboard with little protection against viewing from outside and a screen mounted on the dashboard. This design is well-known since Tesla Model 3 and Model Y use it. Some like it, while others prefer other types of design.

## Center console design

Several types of center console design that manufacturers use in car cockpits. These include:

### Traditional center console

This design is the most common center console design, which features a box-shaped unit between the driver and front passenger seats. It typically includes storage compartments, cup holders, and various controls for the car's audio and climate systems.

### Integrated center console

This type of center console integrates seamlessly into the car's dashboard or instrument panel. In addition, it may feature touchscreens or other advanced features that fully integrate into the car's overall design.

This design typically focuses on the best possible experience for the driver.

### Floating center console

A floating center console is not attached to the floor or dash at the front end, giving a space between the driver and the front passenger.

For many, this is less than ideal design since stuff can move between driver and passenger. It does not give the full cockpit feeling that many looks for.

### Minimalistic storage and armrest only

This design gives only a storage area and an armrest. It is not connected to the dashboard and offers open space between the driver and the front passenger. This design is typical for vans, but you can also find it in regular evs.
