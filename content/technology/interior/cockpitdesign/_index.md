There are several types of center console designs that are commonly used in car cockpits. These include:

### Floating center console

This design is becoming increasingly popular in modern cars, especially those with a more futuristic or high-tech aesthetic. A floating center console is not attached to the floor or dash at the front end and gives a open space between driver and front passenger.

For many this is less than ideal design since stuff can move between driver and passenger. It does not give the full cokpit feeling that many looks for.
