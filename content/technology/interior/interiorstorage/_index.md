Interior storage can include compartments, pockets, bins, trays, or holders that are located in various parts of the car, such as the doors, the center console, the glove box, the seat backs, etc. Interior storage can be visible or hidden, fixed or flexible, open or closed depending on the car model and preferences.

EVs have more interior storage than their gas-powered counterparts because EVs have fewer and smaller parts that take up space. For example, EVs do not have a large engine under the hood, a transmission tunnel on the floor, or an exhaust system at the rear. This means that EVs can have more space for interior storage in areas such


## Center console storage

## Glove box

A glove box is a compartment in the dashboard of a car that can be used to store small items, such as gloves, documents, maps, etc. A glove box can be locked or unlocked with a key or a button. A glove box can also have a light inside to help the user see the contents. Some EVs have glove boxes that are similar to gas cars, while others have glove boxes that are more spacious or innovative. For example, Tesla Model S has a glove box that can be opened and closed with a touchscreen command. Ford Mustang Mach-E has a glove box that can fit a laptop or a tablet.
