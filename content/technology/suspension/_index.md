## What is the purpose of suspension

A suspension system has two primary purposes
Absorbe uneven roads for increased comfort
Keep the wheels on the ground as much as possible to improve car handling. 

A suspension can be built in different ways, but generally, it consists of two main parts.

### The shock/damper

A shock absorber, often called a damper, absorbs the kinetic energy from uneven roads. 

### The spring

A spring that helps control the ride height.

## Air suspension

On models with air suspension, the coil springs are replaced by airbags or air springs, often made from a rubber and polyurethane composite. A compressor fills these air springs via a reservoir to varying degrees: the more air that goes in, the higher the ride height.

Some models only use the air suspension to adjust for different loads, trying to keep the ride height at the same level. These models typically only have air suspension at the rear axle. Examples are the Mercedes EQC and BMW I4.
