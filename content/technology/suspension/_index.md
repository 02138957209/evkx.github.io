## What is the purpose of suspension?

A suspension system has two primary purposes

- Absorbe uneven roads for increased comfort
- Keep the wheels on the ground as much as possible to improve car handling.

 Car producers can build suspensions differently, but generally, it consists of two main parts.

- A shock absorber, often called a damper, absorbs the kinetic energy from uneven roads. 
- A spring that helps control the ride height.

## Constructions

The manufacturers construct the EVs with different types of suspension,  but there is some typical design. 

### MacPherson strut

The MacPherson strut is an automotive suspension system that uses the top of a telescopic damper as the upper steering pivot. Car manufacturers use MacPherson strut as the front suspension on medium to low-priced EVs. The name comes from the engineer Earle S. MacPherson, who invented and developed the design.

A MacPherson strut uses a wishbone or a substantial compression link stabilized by a secondary link, which provides a mounting point for the hub carrier or axle of the wheel.

### Double Wishbone

A double wishbone suspension is an independent suspension design for automobiles using two (occasionally parallel) wishbone-shaped arms to locate the wheel. 

Each wishbone or arm has two mounting points to the chassis and one joint at the knuckle. The shock absorber and coil spring mount to the wishbones to control vertical movement. Double wishbone designs allow the engineer to carefully control the motion of the wheel throughout suspension travel, controlling such parameters as camber angle, caster angle, toe pattern, roll center height, scrub radius, scuff and more.

## Air suspension

On models with air suspension, the coil springs are replaced by airbags or air springs, often made from a rubber and polyurethane composite. A compressor fills these air springs via a reservoir to varying degrees: the more air that goes in, the higher the ride height.

Some models only use the air suspension to adjust for different loads, trying to keep the ride height at the same level. These models typically only have air suspension at the rear axle. Examples are the Mercedes EQC and BMW I4.

On other models, the driver can set the drive height based on drive mode. For example, below is a diagram for the Audi Q8 e-tron showing the ride height for the different modes.

## Adaptive damping

In an EV fitted with adaptive dampers, the driver can change the characteristics of a car’s suspension via driving modes, ranging from “normal” or “comfort” settings that are best suited to everyday driving or “dynamic” and “sport” settings that stiffen the chassis and responses for even sportier driving. Some also have an “auto” setting that adjusts based on the road.
