## What is the purpose of suspension?

A suspension system has two primary purposes

- Absorbe uneven roads for increased comfort
- Keep the wheels on the ground as much as possible to improve car handling.

 Car producers can build suspensions differently, but generally, it consists of two main parts.

- A shock absorber, often called a damper, absorbs the kinetic energy from uneven roads. 
- A spring that helps control the ride height.

## Constructions

The manufacturers construct the EVs with different types of suspension,  but there is some typical design. 

### MacPherson strut

The MacPherson strut is an automotive suspension system that uses the top of a telescopic damper as the upper steering pivot. Car manufacturers use MacPherson strut as the front suspension on medium to low-priced EVs. The name comes from the engineer Earle S. MacPherson, who invented and developed the design.

A MacPherson strut uses a wishbone or a substantial compression link stabilized by a secondary link, which provides a mounting point for the hub carrier or axle of the wheel.

#### Pros:

- Simplified design: MacPherson struts consist of fewer components than traditional shock-absorber-and-spring systems, making them easier to install and maintain.
- More space-efficient: They take up less space than other types of suspension systems, leaving more room for other components, such as the engine and transmission.
- Good handling: MacPherson struts provide good handling and stability on the road, especially in high-speed maneuvers and cornering.
- Cost-effective: They are generally less expensive than other types of suspension systems, making them a popular choice for budget-conscious vehicle manufacturers.


#### Cons:

- Limited adjustability: MacPherson struts are not as adjustable as other types of suspension systems, making it more difficult to fine-tune the ride and handling characteristics.
- Less durable: They may be less durable than other types of suspension systems, especially in harsh driving conditions or off-road use.
- Bump steer: MacPherson struts can cause a phenomenon called bump steer, which occurs when the suspension geometry changes during cornering, causing the wheels to steer unintentionally.
- Uneven tire wear: MacPherson struts can cause uneven tire wear, especially when driving on rough roads or over bumps.

Overall, MacPherson struts are a popular choice for many vehicles due to their simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and good handling characteristics. However, they may not be the best choice for every driving situation, and some drivers may prefer other types of suspension systems that offer more adjustability and durability.

### Double Wishbone

Double wishbone suspension is a type of independent suspension system commonly used in high-performance and luxury vehicles. The suspension design features two A-shaped control arms (also called wishbones) that are connected to the chassis and the wheel hub assembly. 


The upper and lower wishbones work together to control the vertical movement of the wheel, while allowing for some degree of lateral and longitudinal movement.

#### Pros:

- Improved handling: The double wishbone suspension allows for more precise control of the wheel's movement, resulting in better handling, steering response, and stability, especially during high-speed cornering.
- Better ride quality: The design reduces the impact of bumps and road imperfections, resulting in a smoother ride.
- Good camber control: The double wishbone suspension allows for better camber control, which is important for maintaining tire contact with the road during hard cornering.
- More adjustable: The suspension is highly adjustable, allowing for fine-tuning of the handling characteristics, ride height, and suspension geometry.


#### Cons:

- Complex design: The double wishbone suspension is more complex and expensive to design, manufacture, and maintain than other types of suspension systems, such as MacPherson struts.
- Space requirements: The suspension takes up more space than other types of suspension, which can limit the vehicle's design and packaging options.
- Heavy: The suspension can be heavier than other types of suspension systems, which can affect the vehicle's weight and fuel economy.
- Cost: Due to its complexity, the double wishbone suspension can be more expensive to repair or replace in case of damage or wear.

Overall, the double wishbone suspension is a popular choice for high-performance and luxury vehicles due to its superior handling, ride quality, and adjustability. However, its complexity, space requirements, and cost can be drawbacks for some applications.

## Air suspension

On models with air suspension, the coil springs are replaced by airbags or air springs, often made from a rubber and polyurethane composite. A compressor fills these air springs via a reservoir to varying degrees: the more air that goes in, the higher the ride height.

Some models only use the air suspension to adjust for different loads, trying to keep the ride height at the same level. These models typically only have air suspension at the rear axle. Examples are the Mercedes EQC and BMW I4.

On other models, the driver can set the drive height based on drive mode. For example, below is a diagram for the Audi Q8 e-tron showing the ride height for the different modes.

## Adaptive damping

Adaptive damping suspension is a technology that adjusts the damping of a car's suspension system in real-time based on the driving conditions and the driver's preferences. The damping of a suspension system determines how much the suspension compresses and rebounds when the car encounters bumps and rough road surfaces.

In an adaptive damping suspension system, sensors are used to detect the motion of the car, including its speed, acceleration, and the state of the road surface. This information is then used by a computer to adjust the damping of the suspension system in real-time. The computer can also take into account the driver's preferences, such as a sporty or comfortable driving style.

There are several different types of adaptive damping suspension systems, but they all aim to provide a smoother, more comfortable ride while also improving the car's handling and stability. Some systems use magnetic fluid in the shock absorbers to adjust the damping, while others use electronic solenoids to control the flow of hydraulic fluid.

Overall, adaptive damping suspension can improve the driving experience by providing a more comfortable ride and better handling, especially on uneven or bumpy roads.
