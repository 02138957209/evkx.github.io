 Charging an EV battery involves the movement of electric charge carriers, such as electrons and ions, between the electrodes of the battery. The battery consists of two electrodes, a cathode and an anode, which are separated by an electrolyte.

During the charging process, electrons flow from the charging source (e.g., charging station) to the cathode, where they are stored in the cathode material. At the same time, positive ions in the electrolyte flow from the cathode to the anode through the separator.

When the battery is fully charged, the cathode material is at its maximum capacity to store electrons, and the anode is fully depleted of positive ions. The battery is in a stable state with a high potential difference between the cathode and the anode, which is what provides the electric energy stored in the battery.

The charging process is reversible, and during discharge, the electrons flow back from the cathode to the anode through an external circuit, creating a flow of electric current that can power an electric motor.

### Charging performance

The charging performance varies a lot between EVs. There is serveral aspects that affects the charging speed
