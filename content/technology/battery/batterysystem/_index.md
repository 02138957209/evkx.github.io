Today this is most typically achieved with the Cell2Module technology. Where cells are grouped into modules that again are grouped into a battery system.

In the future, we will see cars with Cell2Pack technologies where cells are put directly into packs and even Cell2Car technology where cells are put directly into the car. More about that later

Typical a battery pack consists of modules that consist of several cells.

## Battery configuration

In an electric vehicle (EV), the battery configuration refers to the arrangement of individual battery cells within the battery pack. The configuration can affect the voltage, capacity, power output, and other aspects of the battery pack and the overall vehicle performance.

The most common configuration for EV batteries is a series-parallel hybrid configuration. In this configuration, multiple cells are connected in series to increase the voltage of the battery pack, and multiple groups of series-connected cells are then connected in parallel to increase the overall capacity of the battery pack.

The series connection of cells increases the voltage output of the battery pack, which is important for providing the necessary power output to drive the vehicle. The parallel connection of cell groups increases the capacity of the battery pack, which is important for providing the necessary energy storage to drive the vehicle for a desired range.

The specific battery configuration used in an EV depends on a variety of factors, such as the desired range, power output, and overall vehicle weight. Configurations with higher voltage output and greater capacity can provide longer ranges and higher power output, but can also be more expensive and heavier.

Additionally, the battery configuration can affect the charging time of the battery pack. The charging time is influenced by the capacity of the battery pack and the charging rate, which can be limited by the battery configuration. For example, a larger battery pack with a higher voltage may require a more powerful charging infrastructure to achieve faster charging times.

Overall, the battery configuration in an EV is an important design consideration that can have a significant impact on the performance, range, and charging characteristics of the vehicle.


## Battery pack designs


## Cell-to-module

Cell-to-module (C2M) is a technology used in electric vehicle (EV) battery packs that allows for a more modular and scalable design compared to traditional battery pack designs.

In a traditional EV battery pack, individual battery cells are connected to form a module, and multiple modules are then connected in series and/or parallel to form the complete battery pack. This can be complex and expensive, especially in large battery packs, and may require extensive wiring and cooling systems to ensure even charging and discharging of the cells.

With C2M technology, multiple battery cells are assembled into a single, self-contained module with integrated electronics and cooling systems. The modules can then be easily connected together to form the complete battery pack. Each module has its own BMS (battery management system) that monitors and controls the charging and discharging of the cells within the module, allowing for more precise control and monitoring of the individual cells.

C2M technology has several advantages over traditional battery pack designs. It can simplify the overall design of the battery pack, reduce wiring and cooling requirements, and allow for greater flexibility in the overall pack design. It can also improve the overall reliability of the pack, since each module is self-contained and faults can be detected and isolated more quickly.

## Cell-to-pack

Cell-to-pack (C2P) is a technology used in electric vehicle (EV) battery packs that eliminates the need for a separate battery management system (BMS).

In a traditional EV battery pack, individual battery cells are connected to a central BMS that monitors and controls the charging and discharging of each cell. This can be complex and expensive, especially in large battery packs.

With C2P technology, the individual cells are connected directly to the vehicle's power electronics without the need for a central BMS. This is made possible by using a dedicated microcontroller in each battery cell to monitor and report on its status. These microcontrollers can communicate with each other and with the vehicle's power electronics to ensure that the cells are charged and discharged evenly and safely.

C2P technology has several advantages over traditional battery pack designs. It can reduce the weight and complexity of the battery pack, as well as increase its energy density. It can also improve the overall reliability of the pack, since each cell is monitored individually and faults can be detected and isolated more quickly.

Overall, cell-to-pack technology is a promising innovation in EV battery design that could help reduce costs and improve performance.

## Structural battery pack

A structural battery pack is a type of battery pack that is integrated into the structure of a vehicle or other device, serving both as a source of power and as a structural component. This approach can reduce the weight and complexity of the device, while also improving its overall performance and efficiency.

In a traditional battery pack, the battery cells are usually arranged in a specific configuration and enclosed within a protective casing. This casing adds weight and complexity to the overall design of the device, and may require additional support structures to ensure proper installation and operation.

With a structural battery pack, the battery cells are integrated directly into the vehicle or device's structure, such as the chassis or body panels. The battery cells themselves serve as both a source of power and as a structural component, providing support and strength to the overall design. This approach can reduce the overall weight of the device and improve its efficiency by eliminating the need for separate support structures and protective casings.

Structural battery packs are still a relatively new concept, but they are being explored and developed by a number of companies and research institutions. They have the potential to revolutionize the design of electric vehicles and other devices by reducing weight and complexity, improving performance, and making it easier to integrate battery technology into a wide range of applications.
