Typically, EV batteries come with a warranty that covers a certain number of years or a certain number of miles driven, whichever comes first.

In terms of capacity, some EV manufacturers may offer a warranty that guarantees a minimum level of battery capacity for a certain period of time. For example, a manufacturer might offer a warranty that guarantees the battery will maintain at least 70% of its original capacity for 8 years or 100,000 miles, whichever comes first.

The warranty may also take into account the age of the battery. For example, a manufacturer might offer a warranty that covers any defects in materials or workmanship for the first 3 years, and then cover the battery against a drop in capacity below a certain level for an additional 5 years.

It's important to note that the specific terms of the warranty can vary widely between manufacturers, so it's always a good idea to carefully review the warranty information before purchasing an EV.
