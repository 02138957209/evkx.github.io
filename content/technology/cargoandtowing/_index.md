The article will be split into four sections: trunk cargo, roof cargo, tow hitch cargo, and towing. Each section will discuss the pros and cons, the factors to consider, 
and the best practices for using EVs for cargo and towing. I hope this article will help you understand and appreciate the potential and the challenges of EVs for cargo and towing.

### Roof Cargo

One possible solution is to use roof cargo, such as racks or boxes, to increase the storage capacity of EVs.

However, roof cargo also has some drawbacks and limitations that EV owners should be aware of before installing them on their vehicles.
