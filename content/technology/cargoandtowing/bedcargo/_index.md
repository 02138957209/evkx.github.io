However, EV pickup trucks also have some drawbacks and limitations that EV owners should be aware of before using them. In this article, we will explore factors that affect the performance and feasibility of cargo in EV pickup truck beds and provide some tips and recommendations for choosing and using them.

## What Can Be Stored in EV Pickup Trucks Bed

The EV pickup truck bed is the open space at the rear of the vehicle that can be used to store and transport various items. 

The size and shape of the bed vary depending on the model and design of the EV pickup truck, but generally, they are rectangular and flat, with a tailgate that can be opened or closed. The bed can also have features or accessories that can help secure or organize the items, such as tie-downs, hooks, rails, covers, liners, or dividers.

The items that can be stored in EV pickup trucks bed depend on the dimensions and capacity of the bed, as well as the weight and shape of the items. Generally, the bed can accommodate items that are longer, wider, or taller than the trunk or frunk of the vehicle, such as mattresses, sofas, tables, or cabinets. However, the bed may not be able to fit items that are too long, too wide, or too tall for the bed, such as ladders, pipes, or kayaks. The bed can also carry items that are heavier than the trunk or frunk of the vehicle, such as generators, lawnmowers, or snowblowers. However, the bed may not be able to handle items that are too heavy for the bed, such as motorcycles, ATVs, or hot tubs.

The items that can be stored in EV pickup trucks bed also depend on the payload and towing capacity of the vehicle, as well as the range and efficiency of the battery. The payload capacity is the maximum weight that the vehicle can carry, including the passengers and the cargo. The towing capacity is the maximum weight that the vehicle can pull, including the trailer and the cargo. The range is the maximum distance that the vehicle can drive on a single charge. The efficiency is the amount of energy that the vehicle consumes per unit of distance.

The payload and towing capacity of EV pickup trucks vary depending on the model and design of the vehicle, but generally, they are lower than conventional pickup trucks, as EVs have heavier batteries and motors that take up some of the weight and space. For example, the Tesla Cybertruck has a payload capacity of 2,500 lbs and a towing capacity of 11,000 lbs, while the Ford F-150 Lightning has a payload capacity of 2,000 lbs and a towing capacity of 10,000 lbs.

The range and efficiency of EV pickup trucks also vary depending on the model and design of the vehicle, but generally, they are affected by the weight and drag of the cargo, as adding more weight or drag can increase the energy consumption and reduce the battery efficiency. For example, the Tesla Cybertruck has a range of 250 to 500 miles, while the Ford F-150 Lightning has a range of 230 to 300 miles.

Therefore, EV owners should be aware of the limitations and trade-offs of storing and transporting items in EV pickup trucks bed, and choose the items that are suitable for the size, shape, weight, and capacity of the bed and the vehicle. They should also check the battery level and range of the vehicle before and during the trip, and factor in the extra energy consumption and range reduction caused by the cargo. They should also plan their route and charging stops ahead of time, and choose the roads and stations that are compatible with their vehicle and their cargo.

## What Are the Benefits of EV Pickup Trucks Bed over Other Storage

Despite the drawbacks and limitations of EV pickup trucks bed, they also have some benefits over other storage options, such as trunks, frunks, roof racks, or trailers. Here are some of the benefits of EV pickup trucks bed over other storage:

### More space and flexibility

EV pickup trucks bed can offer more space and flexibility than trunks, frunks, roof racks, or trailers, as they can accommodate items that are longer, wider, or taller than other storage options. EV pickup trucks bed can also be customized or modified to fit different items or purposes, such as adding covers, liners, dividers, or accessories to protect or organize the items. EV pickup trucks bed can also be used for other functions, such as camping, tailgating, or working, as they can provide a flat and open surface that can be equipped with power outlets, lights, speakers, or tools.

### Easier access and loading

EV pickup trucks bed can offer easier access and loading than trunks, frunks, roof racks, or trailers, as they can be reached and opened from the rear of the vehicle, without having to open the doors, lift the hood, or climb the roof. EV pickup trucks bed can also be loaded and unloaded more easily and safely, as they can be lowered or raised with the tailgate, without having to lift or lower the items over the vehicle or the trailer. EV pickup trucks bed can also be accessed and loaded from multiple sides, without having to move or adjust the vehicle or the trailer.

### Less impact and hassle

EV pickup trucks bed can have less impact and hassle than roof racks or trailers, as they can reduce the weight and drag of the cargo, which in turn can reduce the energy consumption and range reduction of the vehicle. EV pickup trucks bed can also avoid some of the problems or risks associated with roof racks or trailers, such as damage, theft, noise, or instability of the items, or difficulty, danger, or legality of driving, parking, or maneuvering the vehicle or the trailer.
