However, not all cars have enough space inside to accommodate all the items that the owner may want to store or transport. That is why some car owners resort to other options, such as roof cargo carriers or hitch cargo carriers, to increase their cargo capacity. But are these options better than using the interior cargo space of the car? What are the benefits and drawbacks of having the cargo inside the car? How can the interior cargo space be maximized and secured? This article will try to answer these questions and provide some tips for using the interior cargo space of the car effectively.

## Benefits of Interior Cargo

Interior cargo refers to the cargo space that is enclosed and protected by the car's body and windows. Interior cargo can vary depending on the model and the configuration of the car, but some cars have impressive interior cargo capacities that can rival or surpass those of exterior cargo carriers. For example, the Tesla Model 3 has a rear trunk with 15 cubic feet of storage and a front trunk with 2.7 cubic feet of space. When the rear seats are folded, the interior cargo capacity expands to 43 cubic feethttps://www.cars.com/articles/which-suvs-minivans-and-sedans-have-the-most-cargo-capacity-439514/. The Honda Civic Hatchback has a rear trunk with 25.7 cubic feet of storage and a 60/40 split-folding rear seat. When the rear seats are folded, the interior cargo capacity expands to 46.2 cubic feethttps://www.consumerreports.org/cars/buying-a-car/cargo-room-for-cars-by-vehicle-category-a8904187384/.

Interior cargo has some advantages that make it preferable to other options, such as:

### Security

Interior cargo is more secure and safe than exterior cargo, as it is less visible and more difficult to access by thieves or vandals. Interior cargo is also less likely to fly off or get damaged by weather, road debris, or collisions. Interior cargo can also be locked with the car's central locking system or alarm system for extra protection.

### Accessibility

Interior cargo is more accessible and convenient than exterior cargo, as it does not require climbing onto the roof or reaching behind the car to load or unload the items. Interior cargo can also be accessed from inside the car through the rear seats or the rear doors, which can be useful in tight parking spaces or bad weather conditions.

### Fuel economy

Interior cargo has less impact on the car's fuel economy than exterior cargo, as it does not affect the car's aerodynamics or wind resistance. Exterior cargo carriers, especially roof cargo carriers, can increase the car's drag and reduce its fuel efficiency by up to 25%https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/toyota/camry/2021/interior. Interior cargo can also lower the car's center of gravity and improve its stability and handling.

## Drawbacks of Interior Cargo

Interior cargo is not without its drawbacks, however. Some of the limitations and challenges of using the interior cargo space of the car are:

### Capacity

Interior cargo has a limited capacity that cannot be exceeded without compromising the car's performance, safety, or legality. Interior cargo cannot exceed the car's maximum payload, which is the total weight of the passengers and the cargo that the car can carry. Interior cargo also cannot exceed the car's maximum volume, which is the total space available inside the car for the cargo. Interior cargo also cannot obstruct the driver's view or interfere with the car's lights or signals.

### Compatibility

Interior cargo may not be compatible with all types of items that the owner may want to store or transport. Interior cargo may not be able to accommodate large, bulky, or irregular items that do not fit inside the car or that may damage the car's interior. Interior cargo may also not be suitable for items that are dirty, wet, or smelly, as they may stain, damage, or contaminate the car's interior.

### Comfort

Interior cargo may reduce the comfort and convenience of the passengers and the driver, as it may take up some of the space that would otherwise be used for seating, legroom, or storage. Interior cargo may also create noise, vibration, or odor that may disturb the passengers and the driver. Interior cargo may also affect the car's climate control system, as it may block the air vents or the windows.

## Tips for Using Interior Cargo

To use the interior cargo space of the car effectively, here are some tips that may help:

•  Choose the right car. If you need a lot of interior cargo space, choose a car that has a large trunk, a hatchback, or a foldable rear seat. You can also look for cars that have additional storage spaces, such as a front trunk, a hidden compartment, or a roof box.

•  Plan ahead. Before loading the car, plan what items you need to carry and how you will arrange them inside the car. Try to pack the items in boxes, bags, or containers that are easy to stack and secure. Avoid overloading the car or leaving unnecessary gaps between the items. Load the heavier items first and place them on the bottom or near the center of the car. Load the lighter items last and place them on the top or near the sides of the car. Consider the order of loading and unloading the items, and place the items that you need to access frequently or first near the doors or the seats.

•  Secure the cargo. Make sure that the cargo is properly secured and does not move or shift during the trip. You can use straps, nets, bungees, or dividers to hold the items in place. You can also use anti-slip mats, edge protectors, or blankets to prevent the items from sliding or scratching. Do not stack the items too high or too close to the driver's seat. Do not block the driver's view or the car's lights or signals. Do not exceed the car's maximum payload or volume.

•  Drive safely. Adjust your driving style according to the weight and the distribution of the cargo. Drive smoothly and avoid sudden changes of speed or direction. Check the tire pressure and the suspension of the car and adjust them if needed. Check the cargo at regular intervals and make sure it is still secure. If you notice any signs of instability or damage, stop at the nearest safe place and fix the problem.

Conclusion

Interior cargo in cars can be a great option for carrying various kinds of items, as it offers security, accessibility, and fuel economy. However, interior cargo in cars also has some drawbacks, such as capacity, compatibility, and comfort. By following the tips above, you can use the interior cargo space of the car effectively and safely.
