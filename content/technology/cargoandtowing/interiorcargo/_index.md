What are the benefits and drawbacks of having the cargo inside the car? How can the interior cargo space be maximized and secured? This article will answer these questions and provide some tips for using the interior cargo space of the car effectively.

## Capacity

The cargo capacity varies greatly depending on the car type and the kind of solutions the manufacturer has chosen.

Most cars can fold the rear seats flat. When doing this, it can increase the cargo capacity. Typical cars have a 40:60 split or a 40:20:40 split on the rear seats to put down 3, 2, or 1 of the back seat.

For 3-row cars, the driver can typically fold both third and second-row seats flat.

The following table lists the trunk and max space with rear seats folded flat for many popular models.

Serveral models have hidden storage below the floor in the trunk.

## Securing cargo

Many models have securing hooks in the trunk to fasten storage, while others do not.
The driver can fasten a net or other securing mechanism to the hooks to ensure the cargo does not come flying if you crash.

## Camping

Many EVs are great for camping since they can heat when parked. Many have a camping mode for the air conditioning.

Some manufacturers even offer mattresses to use in the rear.

## Advantages of interior cargo

Interior cargo has some advantages that make it preferable to other options, such as:

### Security

Interior cargo is more secure and safe than exterior cargo, as it is less visible and more difficult to access by thieves or vandals. Interior cargo is also less likely to fly off or get damaged by weather, road debris, or collisions. Interior cargo can also be locked with the car's central locking system or alarm system for extra protection.

### Accessibility

Interior cargo is more accessible and convenient than exterior cargo, as it does not require climbing onto the roof or reaching behind the car to load or unload the items. Interior cargo can also be accessed from inside the car through the rear seats or the rear doors, which can be useful in tight parking spaces or bad weather conditions.

### Fuel economy

Interior cargo has less impact on the car's fuel economy than exterior cargo, as it does not affect the car's aerodynamics or wind resistance. Exterior cargo carriers, especially roof cargo carriers, can increase the car's drag and reduce its fuel efficiency by up to 25%. Interior cargo can also lower the car's center of gravity and improve its stability and handling.

## Possible limitations of Interior Cargo

Interior cargo is not without its drawbacks, however. Some of the limitations and challenges of using the interior cargo space of the car are:

### Weight capacity

Interior cargo has a limited capacity that cannot be exceeded without compromising the car's performance, safety, or legality. Interior cargo cannot exceed the car's maximum payload, which is the total weight of the passengers and the cargo that the car can carry.


### Compatibility

Interior cargo may not be compatible with all types of items that the owner may want to store or transport. Interior cargo may not be able to accommodate large, bulky, or irregular items that do not fit inside the car or that may damage the car's interior. Interior cargo may also not be suitable for items that are dirty, wet, or smelly, as they may stain, damage, or contaminate the car's interior.

### Comfort

Interior cargo may reduce the comfort and convenience of the passengers and the driver, as it may take up some of the space that would otherwise be used for seating, legroom, or storage. Interior cargo may also create noise, vibration, or odor that may disturb the passengers and the driver. Interior cargo may also affect the car's climate control system, as it may block the air vents or the windows.

## Conclusion

Interior cargo in cars can be a great option for carrying various kinds of items, as it offers security, accessibility, and fuel economy. However, interior cargo in cars also has some drawbacks, such as capacity, compatibility, and comfort. By following the tips above, you can use the interior cargo space of the car effectively and safely.
