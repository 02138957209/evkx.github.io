In this article, I will explain what frunks are, what types of cargo they can hold, what are the possibilities and the limitations of frunks, and what are some examples of EVs with frunks.

## What are frunks?

Frunk is a portmanteau of "front" and "trunk", and it refers to the cargo space that is available at the front of an EV. Frunks are possible because EVs do not have a conventional engine under the hood, but instead have batteries and other components that are usually placed low down within the vehicle's structure. This leaves some space at the front that can be used for storage. Frunks are not a new concept, as some mid-engine or rear-engine vehicles, such as the Porsche 911 or the Volkswagen Beetle, also have frunks. However, frunks have become more common and prominent with the rise of EVs, as they offer a unique and convenient way to increase the cargo capacity of EVs.

## What types of cargo can frunks hold?

Frunk cargo can vary depending on the size, shape, and design of the frunk, as well as the items that the owner wants to store or transport. Frunks can hold various types of cargo, such as groceries, luggage, camping gear, sports equipment, or pets. Frunks can also be used for specific purposes, such as keeping items cool, dry, or secure.

For example, some frunks have insulation, drainage, or locking features that can make them suitable for storing food, beverages, or valuables. Frunks can also be customized or accessorized with dividers, nets, bags, or boxes to organize and protect the cargo.


## What are the possibilities of frunks?

Frunk cargo can offer many possibilities and advantages for EV owners, such as:

### Extra storage

Frunks can provide more storage space for EVs, especially for those that have limited trunk or cabin space. Frunks can also allow EV owners to carry more items or larger items that would not fit in the trunk or the cabin. Frunks can also free up some space in the trunk or the cabin for other purposes, such as passengers or luggage.

### Easy access

Frunks can provide easy access to the cargo, as they are located at the front of the vehicle and do not require opening or closing the rear door or the tailgate. Frunks can also be opened or closed remotely, using a key fob, a button, or a smartphone app. Frunks can also be useful for loading or unloading items in tight parking spaces, where opening the rear door or the tailgate might be difficult or impossible.

### Improved safety

Frunks can provide improved safety for the cargo and the vehicle, as they are enclosed and protected by the vehicle's body and windows. Frunks can also prevent the cargo from flying around or hitting the passengers in case of a sudden stop or a collision. Frunks can also reduce the risk of theft, as they are less visible and more secure than the trunk or the cabin.

## What are some examples of EVs with frunks?

There are many EVs on the market or in development that have frunks, but some of them stand out for their size, design, and features.

## Conclusion

Frunk cargo in EVs can be a great feature that can increase the storage, convenience, and safety of EVs. However, frunk cargo in EVs also has some limitations and challenges that EV owners need to be aware of and consider before using them. EV owners need to choose the right EV model and the right frunk type for their needs, and make sure they are compatible and suitable. EV owners also need to respect the capacity and the clearance of the frunk, and secure and protect their cargo properly. By following these tips and guidelines, EV owners can enjoy the benefits and the possibilities of frunk cargo in EVs, and have a smooth and satisfying transportation and storage experience.
