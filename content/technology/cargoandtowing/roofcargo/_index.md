However, roof cargo has some drawbacks and limitations that EV owners should know before installing it on their vehicles.
In this article, we will explore some factors that affect the performance and feasibility of roof cargo on EVs and provide some tips and recommendations for choosing and using them.

## How Roof Cargo Affects EV Range

The main concern that EV owners have when using roof cargo is how it will affect their range or how far they can drive on a single charge. Roof cargo can reduce the range of EVs by increasing the weight and aerodynamic drag of the vehicle, increasing the energy consumption, and reducing the range.

The amount of range reduction depends on several factors, such as the type, size, shape, and weight of the roof cargo, the speed and driving conditions of the vehicle, and the design and specifications of the EV.

According to some studies and experiments, roof cargo can reduce the range of EVs by anywhere from 2% to 40%, depending on the abovementioned variables.

The type of roof cargo can make a significant difference in the range reduction. Generally, roof boxes are more aerodynamic than roof racks, as they have a smoother and more streamlined shape that reduces air resistance.

However, roof boxes also add more weight and height to the vehicle, increasing energy consumption and reducing stability.

However, roof boxes also add more weight and height to the vehicle, increasing energy consumption and reducing stability.

Roof racks, on the other hand, are lighter and lower than roof boxes, but they expose the items to the airflow, creating more drag and noise. The shape and size of the items on the roof rack also affect the aerodynamics and range of the vehicle.

For example, carrying a bike on a roof rack can reduce the range of an EV by 10% to 15%, while maintaining a kayak can reduce it by 20% to 40%.

The speed and driving conditions of the vehicle also influence the range reduction. Generally, the faster the car goes, the more drag and energy consumption it experiences and the more range it loses.

Driving on highways or in windy weather can exacerbate the effect of roof cargo on the range of EVs.

Conversely, driving at lower speeds or in urban areas can mitigate the impact of roof cargo, as the air resistance and energy consumption are lower. However, driving in stop-and-go traffic or on hilly roads can also increase energy consumption and range reduction, as the vehicle needs to accelerate and decelerate more frequently or overcome gravity.

The design and specifications of the EV also play a role in the range reduction. EVs have different battery capacities, efficiencies, and aerodynamics, which affect how they cope with roof cargo's extra weight and drag. For example, EVs with larger or higher efficiencies can have more range to spare than those with smaller or lower efficiencies.

EVs with better aerodynamics or lower weights can also have higher range reduction than EVs with worse aerodynamics or higher weights.
