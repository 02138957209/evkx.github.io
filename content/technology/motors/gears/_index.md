Here are some common types of gears used in EV drive units:

**Single-Speed Gearbox:** Many EVs use a single-speed gearbox, also known as a direct drive or fixed gear transmission. This type of gearbox does not have multiple gears and consists of a single ratio, typically with a gear reduction from the electric motor to the wheels. Single-speed gearboxes are simple, lightweight, and compact, and are often used in smaller EVs or those designed for city driving, where a wide range of gear ratios is not necessary.

**Multi-Speed Gearbox:** Some EVs, particularly high-performance or larger vehicles like Porsche Taycan and Audi e-tron GT use multi-speed gearboxes, similar to those used in traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. 

These gearboxes have multiple gear ratios that allow the electric motor to operate at its optimal efficiency over a wider range of speeds and loads. Multi-speed gearboxes can provide improved acceleration, top speed, and overall performance, especially in situations where a wide range of speeds and driving conditions are encountered.

**Reduction Gearbox:** In many EVs, a reduction gearbox is used to lower the speed of the electric motor and increase the torque output to the wheels. Reduction gearboxes are used to match the relatively high rotational speed of the electric motor with the lower rotational speed required by the wheels for efficient operation. These gearboxes typically consist of one or more gear stages that reduce the motor speed while increasing the torque output, allowing the EV to achieve high levels of torque for quick acceleration and improved performance.

**Differential Gear:** A differential gear is a type of gear mechanism that allows the wheels of an EV to rotate at different speeds when turning, while still transmitting power from the electric motor to the wheels. Differentials are used to distribute power evenly between the wheels, ensuring smooth and controlled handling during turns. They are commonly used in EVs with multiple driven wheels, such as all-wheel-drive (AWD) or four-wheel-drive (4WD) systems.

**Limited-Slip Differential (LSD):** Some EVs may also use a limited-slip differential, which provides better traction and handling by partially locking the differential to prevent excessive wheel slip. LSDs are particularly useful in EVs for improved performance in challenging driving conditions, such as slippery surfaces or off-road driving, where maintaining traction and stability is important.

It's worth noting that some EVs, particularly those with single-speed gearboxes or direct drive systems, do not use traditional gears at all. Instead, they rely on sophisticated power electronics and motor control algorithms to deliver the required torque and power to the wheels without the need for physical gears. The specific type of gearbox used in an EV drive unit depends on factors such as the vehicle's size, performance requirements, driving conditions, and design considerations.
