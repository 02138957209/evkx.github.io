ABS is a common feature on modern vehicles and works by modulating the brake pressure to each wheel individually.

When the driver applies the brakes, the ABS system uses sensors to detect if any of the wheels are starting to lock up. If a wheel is about to lock up, the ABS system will rapidly and repeatedly release and apply brake pressure to that wheel, preventing it from fully locking up and allowing it to maintain traction with the road. The system can make these adjustments very quickly, often many times per second, to maintain the maximum possible braking force while still preventing wheel lockup.

The ABS system is typically controlled by an electronic control unit (ECU) that receives information from wheel speed sensors and other sensors to determine when wheel lockup is about to occur. Some ABS systems may also incorporate other features, such as electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD), which adjusts the brake pressure to each wheel based on factors such as vehicle weight distribution and braking force, to further improve braking performance and stability.

Overall, ABS is a very effective safety feature that can help prevent accidents and improve vehicle control during emergency braking situations.
