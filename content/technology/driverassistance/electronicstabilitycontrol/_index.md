ESC is a standard safety feature on most modern vehicles and is also sometimes referred to as Electronic Stability Program (ESP) or Vehicle Stability Control (VSC).

ESC works by using sensors and algorithms to monitor the vehicle's speed, steering angle, and other key parameters. If the vehicle begins to lose traction or stability during a sudden maneuver, such as swerving to avoid an obstacle or taking a sharp turn, the ESC system will automatically intervene to help prevent a loss of control.

Here's how ESC works in a general sense:

The ESC system constantly monitors the vehicle's speed, steering angle, and other sensor data to determine the vehicle's intended path.

If the ESC system detects that the vehicle is deviating from its intended path, such as due to oversteer or understeer, it will apply the brakes to individual wheels to help stabilize the vehicle and bring it back onto its intended path.

The ESC system may also reduce engine power to help prevent the vehicle from skidding or spinning out of control.

Once the vehicle is back on its intended path, the ESC system will gradually release the brakes and allow the driver to resume normal control of the vehicle.

The specific details of how ESC works can vary between different vehicles and manufacturers, but the overall goal is to help improve the stability and safety of the vehicle in sudden or challenging driving situations.
