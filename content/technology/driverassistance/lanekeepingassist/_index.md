 Unlike LDW, which only alerts the driver when they are about to leave their lane, LKA actively intervenes by applying steering inputs to keep the vehicle centered within the lane.

LKA uses similar sensors and cameras to LDW to monitor the vehicle's position on the road and the distance between the vehicle and the lane markings. When the system detects that the vehicle is drifting out of its lane, it applies a gentle steering correction to guide the vehicle back to the center of the lane.

LKA typically works at speeds above a certain threshold, usually around 40 mph, and can be activated and deactivated by the driver. Some systems may also include a haptic warning, such as a vibration in the steering wheel or seat, to alert the driver when the system is actively intervening.

Like LDW, it is important to note that LKA is not a substitute for attentive and safe driving practices, and drivers should always remain focused and alert while behind the wheel. LKA is designed to provide an additional layer of safety and convenience, particularly in situations where the driver may be fatigued or distracted.

The European Union (EU) has specific regulations and requirements for Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) systems installed in vehicles. According to the EU regulation 2018/858, LKA is considered an advanced driver assistance system and must comply with several requirements to ensure its safety and effectiveness. On rule is that it should not be possible to permanent turn LKA off.
