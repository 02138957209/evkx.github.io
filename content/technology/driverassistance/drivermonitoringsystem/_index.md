The driver monitoring system can work in various ways, depending on the specific car model and the type of sensor used. Some common features of driver monitoring systems include:

Eye tracking: This feature uses a camera to track the driver's eye movements and detect if they are becoming drowsy or distracted. If the system detects that the driver is not paying attention to the road, it can provide an alert to bring their focus back to driving.

Facial recognition: This feature uses a camera to recognize the driver's face and detect if they are becoming fatigued or distracted. If the system detects that the driver is not alert, it can provide an alert or intervention to prevent accidents.

Steering wheel sensors: This feature uses sensors on the steering wheel to detect if the driver is holding the wheel and making appropriate inputs. If the system detects that the driver is not paying attention or is becoming fatigued, it can provide an alert or intervention to prevent accidents.

Driver monitoring systems are becoming increasingly common in modern cars, and they are often included as part of a larger suite of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). These systems can help prevent accidents caused by driver error or inattention, and they can also provide valuable data to help improve driver behavior and safety.
