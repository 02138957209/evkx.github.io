Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS) are designed to enhance safety by detecting signs of driver fatigue, distraction, or impairment, and providing alerts or interventions to prevent accidents.

## How It Works

Driver monitoring systems can vary depending on the car model and the type of sensors used. Common features include:

### Eye Tracking

This feature uses a camera to track the driver's eye movements and detect signs of drowsiness or distraction. If the system detects that the driver is not paying attention to the road, it provides an alert to refocus their attention on driving.

### Facial Recognition

Facial recognition technology uses a camera to identify the driver's face and monitor for signs of fatigue or distraction. If the system detects that the driver is not alert, it can issue an alert or intervention to prevent accidents.

### Steering Wheel Sensors

These sensors detect if the driver is holding the steering wheel and making appropriate inputs. If the system senses that the driver is not paying attention or is becoming fatigued, it can provide an alert or intervention to ensure safety.

## Benefits

Driver monitoring systems are increasingly common in modern vehicles and are often part of a larger suite of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). These systems help prevent accidents caused by driver error or inattention and provide valuable data to improve driver behavior and safety.
