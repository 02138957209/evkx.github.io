This feature is particularly relevant when the car is parked in a busy area or on the side of a busy road.

The exit warning system uses sensors, cameras, or radar to detect the presence of other vehicles, bicycles, or pedestrians in the vicinity of the car. When a potential hazard is detected, the system provides a warning to the driver or passengers in the form of an audible or visual alert.

The warning may come in the form of a chime, a vibration, or a message on the car's display screen, indicating that it is not safe to open the door. The system may also activate the hazard lights to warn other drivers of the potential danger.

The exit warning ADAS system can work in different ways depending on the specific car model and the type of sensor used. For example, some cars use ultrasonic sensors that are located in the door panels and can detect the presence of other vehicles or objects. Other cars may use cameras or radar sensors that are mounted on the rear of the car and can detect approaching vehicles or pedestrians.

Exit warning ADAS is a useful safety feature that can help prevent accidents and improve overall safety for drivers and passengers. By providing a warning before the door is opened, it can help to prevent collisions with other vehicles or cyclists, especially in urban areas with heavy traffic and limited visibility.
