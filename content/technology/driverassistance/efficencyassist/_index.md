Efficiency Assist works by using data from the vehicle's sensors and onboard computer to analyze the driver's behavior and offer suggestions for improvement. Some common features of Efficiency Assist include:

Regenerative braking optimization: The system monitors the driver's braking behavior and provides suggestions for optimizing regenerative braking, which converts the vehicle's kinetic energy into electrical energy that can be used to recharge the battery.

Speed optimization: The system analyzes the driver's speed and provides suggestions for driving at a more efficient speed, which can help to conserve battery life.

Route optimization: The system can provide suggestions for more efficient routes based on traffic conditions, terrain, and other factors.

Predictive driving: The system can use data from the vehicle's sensors and GPS to anticipate changes in traffic and road conditions and provide suggestions for more efficient driving techniques.
