There are several different types of driver assistance systems available in modern cars, and each one works differently to improve driving performance and safety.


- [Adaptive Cruise Control](adaptivecruisecontrol) (ACC)
- [Lane departuere warning](lanedeparturewarning) (LDW)
- [Lane Keeping Assist](lanekeepingassist) (LKA)
- [Blind-spot monitoring](blindspotmonitoring) (BSM)
- [Forward collision warning](forwardcollisionwarning) (FCW)
- [Automatic emergency braking](automaticemergencybraking) (AEB)
- [Automatic Emergency Steering](automaticemergencysteering) (AES)
- Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA)
- Rearview Camera
- Surround View Camera
- Parking Sensors
- Adaptive Headlights
- Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR)
- Driver Drowsiness Detection
- [Steering Assist](steeringassist)
- Automatic High Beams
- Pedestrian Detection
- [Collision Avoidance Systems](collisionavoidancesystems) (CAS)
- Electronic Stability Control (ESC)
- Anti-lock Braking System (ABS)
- Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)


### Level of autonomous driving

The level of autonomous driving, also known as the autonomy level, refers to the degree of automation and control that a vehicle has over its own operation. There are six levels of autonomy defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) that describe the increasing levels of automation and decreasing need for human input:

**Level 0** - No Automation: The driver is responsible for all aspects of driving, including steering, braking, and accelerating.

**Level 1** - Driver Assistance: The vehicle has some level of automation, such as adaptive cruise control or lane departure warning, but the driver is still responsible for most aspects of driving.

**Level 2** - Partial Automation: The vehicle can control both steering and acceleration/deceleration under certain conditions, but the driver must remain attentive and ready to take control at any time.

**Level 3** - Conditional Automation: The vehicle can handle most driving tasks under certain conditions, but the driver must still be prepared to take over control when necessary.

**Level 4** - High Automation: The vehicle can operate autonomously in certain driving conditions and scenarios, such as on highways or in designated areas, but may still require human intervention in certain situations.

**Level 5** - Full Automation: The vehicle is fully autonomous and can operate in all driving conditions and scenarios without any human input or intervention.

It is important to note that many vehicles on the market today fall into levels 1-2 of autonomy, while levels 3-5 are still in development and testing phases. Additionally, even vehicles with higher levels of autonomy may still require some level of human oversight and intervention in certain situations.
