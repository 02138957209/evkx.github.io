 The system alerts the driver with visual and/or audible warnings to prevent a collision.

Here's how it works:

When the vehicle is put into reverse, the RCTA system uses sensors such as radar or cameras to detect approaching vehicles from the sides.

The system then analyzes the data received from the sensors and determines the distance and speed of the approaching vehicle.

If the system detects a vehicle approaching within a certain range, it will alert the driver with visual and/or audible warnings.

The warning can be in the form of an icon or a flashing light on the side mirrors, or a beep or a chime sound.

The driver can then take evasive action to prevent a collision.

RCTA is a useful safety feature that can help drivers avoid accidents, especially in busy parking lots or narrow streets. However, it is important to note that RCTA is not a substitute for safe driving practices and should be used in conjunction with other safe driving techniques, such as checking blind spots and using side mirrors.
