The technology uses a combination of sensors, cameras, and software to detect and maneuver the car into a parking spot.

## How does it work?

The driver initiates the automatic parking feature, either via a button or through a smartphone app.

The vehicle's sensors and cameras scan the area around the car, using algorithms to determine the available parking spots.

The car begins to slowly move forward until it is positioned correctly for the parking maneuver.

The car uses its sensors and cameras to guide itself into the parking spot, using steering and acceleration to maneuver into the space.

Once the car is in the parking spot, it stops and engages the parking brake.

The driver can then exit the car and lock it remotely, knowing that it is securely parked.

There are different types of automatic parking systems available, and they can vary in terms of the level of autonomy they provide to the vehicle. Some systems require the driver to control the acceleration and braking while the vehicle parks itself, while others are fully autonomous and require no input from the driver at all.

It's important to note that while automatic parking can be a convenient feature, drivers should always remain vigilant and aware of their surroundings, especially in busy or crowded parking lots.
