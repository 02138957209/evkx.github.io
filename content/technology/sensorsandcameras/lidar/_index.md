Lidar, short for "Light Detection and Ranging," is a remote sensing technology that uses laser light to measure distances and generate highly accurate 3D maps of environments. Lidar sensors are commonly used in self-driving cars, robotics, and other applications where precise mapping and object detection is necessary.

Lidar works by emitting laser pulses and measuring the time it takes for the light to bounce back to the sensor. By calculating the round-trip time of the laser, lidar sensors can determine the distance between the sensor and the target object. Multiple laser pulses can be emitted and collected to create a detailed 3D map of the environment.

Lidar sensors can be categorized into two types: scanning lidar and solid-state lidar. Scanning lidar uses a rotating mirror to scan the laser beam across a field of view, while solid-state lidar uses a stationary array of lasers and detectors to measure distance.

One of the main advantages of lidar sensors is their high accuracy and precision. Lidar can accurately measure distances with sub-centimeter precision, making it useful for applications that require high accuracy, such as self-driving cars. Additionally, lidar sensors can operate in a wide range of environmental conditions, including darkness, rain, and fog, making it more reliable than other sensor technologies.

However, lidar sensors can be expensive and require high power consumption. Additionally, lidar sensors can be susceptible to interference from other light sources, such as sunlight or headlights, which can affect their accuracy.

There are serveral producers of LiDAR sensors. [Luminar](https://www.luminartech.com/technology#iris) is one of the largest companies.

Because of the high cost there is still few EVs that comes equipped with it. Even test shows that LiDAR is superior other sensors in some driving scenarios.
