These cameras work by detecting the heat signature of objects, rather than relying on visible light like traditional cameras.

Infrared cameras typically use long-wave infrared (LWIR) or mid-wave infrared (MWIR) radiation to detect heat signatures. LWIR cameras are more commonly used in cars as they are better suited for detecting heat emitted by people and animals, while MWIR cameras are better suited for detecting heat emitted by vehicles.

In cars, infrared cameras are usually mounted on the front of the vehicle and are used to detect obstacles on the road, such as pedestrians or animals. They can also be used to provide enhanced visibility in low light or night-time driving conditions.

One of the main advantages of infrared cameras is their ability to detect objects in complete darkness or low light conditions. They can also detect objects at a greater distance than traditional headlights or high beams, which makes them useful for detecting obstacles on the road ahead.

However, infrared cameras also have some limitations. They can struggle to accurately detect objects that are not emitting a significant amount of heat, such as parked vehicles or stationary objects on the road. In addition, they can be affected by weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, or snow, which can interfere with the heat signatures emitted by objects.

Overall, infrared cameras are an important safety feature in cars that can help drivers detect obstacles on the road in low light or night-time conditions. However, they should not be relied upon as the sole means of detecting obstacles, and drivers should always use caution and other safety features to ensure safe driving.
