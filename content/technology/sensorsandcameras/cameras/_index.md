There are several types of cameras used in ADAS. The most common 

## Forward-facing cameras

These are typically mounted on the windshield or dashboard of the vehicle and are designed to capture images and video of the road ahead.

They are used in features such as 

- [lane departure warning](../../driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/)
- [forward collision warning](../../driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/)
- [automatic emergency braking](../../driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/)
- [Automatic traffic sign recognition](../../driverassistance/trafficsignrecognition/)

## Rear-facing cameras

These are mounted on the back of the vehicle and provide drivers with a view of what is behind the vehicle. They are used in features such as backup cameras and rear cross-traffic alert.

## Side-view cameras

These are mounted on the sides of the vehicle and provide drivers with a view of blind spots. They are used in features such as blind spot monitoring.

## Interior cameras

These are typically mounted on the ceiling of the vehicle and are used in features such as driver monitoring and drowsiness detection.

The cameras used in ADAS are typically high-resolution and use advanced image processing algorithms to analyze the data they capture. For example, the cameras may use object recognition algorithms to identify pedestrians, vehicles, and other objects on the road. They may also use depth sensing to accurately determine the distance between the vehicle and other objects.

Overall, cameras play a critical role in ADAS technologies, providing drivers with real-time information about the environment surrounding the vehicle. They are an essential component of many ADAS features and will continue to play an important role in the development of fully autonomous driving systems.
