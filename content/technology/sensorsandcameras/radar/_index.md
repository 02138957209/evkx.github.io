Radar stands for "Radio Detection and Ranging" and is a sensing technology that uses radio waves to detect the presence and location of objects.

Manufacturers typically place radar sensors on the vehicle's front, rear, and sides. The sensors emit radio waves, which bounce off nearby objects and return to the sensor. By measuring the time it takes for the radio waves to travel to and from an object, radar sensors can determine the distance and speed of the object. 

The radar sensors can be standard or optional, depending on the EV model. Typically, the front sensor is standard on all EVs with radar.

Radar sensors are beneficial for collision avoidance and adaptive cruise control.
For collision avoidance, radar sensors can detect when a car is getting too close to an object, such as another car, and alert the driver or automatically apply the brakes to avoid a collision.

For adaptive cruise control, radar sensors can detect the speed and distance of the car in front of you and adjust the speed of your car accordingly to maintain a safe distance.

The table and diagram below show the types and typical locations of the different radar sensors.

### Pros Radar sensors

- Radar sensors better detect moving vehicles, pedestrians, and objects than cameras or lidars. They can see far-away objects and move quickly, which is helpful in many ADAS.
- Radar sensors also work well in all weather conditions, including rain, snow, and fog. They are not affected by the brightness or darkness of the environment, unlike cameras or lidars.
- Radar sensors are relatively cheap and easy to install and maintain. They have low power consumption and long service life.

### Cons radar sensors

- Radar sensors have lower resolution and accuracy than cameras or lidars. They cannot distinguish objects' shape, color, or texture, which limits their ability to recognize traffic signs, lane markings, or other visual cues.
- Radar sensors may also suffer from interference or false alarms caused by other radar sources, such as vehicles, police radars, or radio towers.
- Radar sensors have a limited field of view and cannot cover the vehicleâ€™s surroundings. They must be combined with other sensors, such as cameras or lidars, to provide a comprehensive and reliable perception of the environment.
