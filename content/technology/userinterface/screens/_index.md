The screens can be used to display a range of information, including battery levels, charging status, navigation, media, and more. The size and layout of the screens can vary from one model to another, but they all serve to make the driver's experience more intuitive and user-friendly.

## Screen types

### Digital instruments

Many cars now feature digital instrument clusters, also known as digital dashboards or driver information displays, that replace traditional analog gauges. These digital screens typically provide information such as speed, battery level,  odometer, trip information, and navigation directions, among others. They may also include customizable displays that allow drivers to choose what information is displayed and how it's presented.

The screen size and functionality varies. Below some examples

### Infotainment screen

The infotainment system is a central screen that combines various multimedia functions in one place. It typically includes a touchscreen interface that allows drivers and passengers to control features such as navigation, audio and video playback, phone connectivity, climate control, and other vehicle settings. Infotainment systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated, with features such as voice recognition, smartphone integration, and app compatibility.

The features that can be controlled from the infotainment screen in cars can vary depending on the make, model, and trim level of the vehicle, as well as the specific infotainment system installed. However, here are some common features that are often accessible through the infotainment screen:

Audio and Media Control: The infotainment screen is typically used to control various audio and media functions, such as changing radio stations, adjusting volume, selecting audio sources (e.g., AM/FM radio, satellite radio, Bluetooth audio streaming, USB media), browsing and selecting music tracks, and controlling audio settings like bass, treble, and equalizer settings.

Navigation and Maps: Many infotainment systems include built-in navigation functionality, allowing users to input destinations, view maps, get turn-by-turn directions, and adjust navigation settings. Some infotainment systems also support real-time traffic information, points of interest (POI) search, and voice-guided navigation.

Phone Connectivity: Infotainment screens often provide phone connectivity options, allowing users to make and receive phone calls, access contacts, view call history, and send/receive text messages. Some systems also support phone book synchronization, call logs, and call management features.

Climate Control: Some vehicles have climate control integrated into the infotainment screen, allowing users to adjust temperature, fan speed, air distribution, and other HVAC functions directly from the screen. This may include controls for both front and rear seat climate settings, if applicable.

Vehicle Settings: Infotainment screens may also provide access to various vehicle settings, such as lighting controls, door lock settings, seat adjustments, and other comfort and convenience features. This may also include customization options for driver preferences, vehicle profiles, and other personalization settings.

Rear View Camera and Parking Assistance: Many modern vehicles come with rearview cameras and parking assistance features, which are typically displayed on the infotainment screen. This allows users to view the rear surroundings of the vehicle and get assistance with parking and maneuvering.

Vehicle Diagnostics and Maintenance: Some infotainment systems provide access to vehicle diagnostics and maintenance information, such as tire pressure monitoring, engine oil life, vehicle health reports, and maintenance reminders.

Connectivity and Apps: Infotainment screens in cars may also provide connectivity options, such as Bluetooth pairing, Wi-Fi hotspot, and app integration. This may allow users to connect their smartphones, use apps, and access online services directly from the infotainment screen.

It's important to note that the availability and features of infotainment screens can vary greatly depending on the specific vehicle and infotainment system installed. It's recommended to refer to the owner's manual or consult with the manufacturer or dealership for information on the specific features and capabilities of the infotainment system in your vehicle.

### Front Passenger screen

In most vehicles, the infotainment screen, which is typically located in the front center console, is primarily designed for the driver's use. However, some modern vehicles may have a secondary screen or display dedicated to the front passenger. The functionality and purpose of this passenger-side screen can vary depending on the make, model, and trim level of the vehicle, and it may offer some or all of the following features:

Media Control: The passenger-side screen may allow the front passenger to control various media functions, such as changing radio stations, adjusting volume, selecting audio sources, and controlling audio settings like bass, treble, and equalizer settings. This can provide the front passenger with the ability to customize their own audio experience during the ride.

Climate Control: Some vehicles may have a separate screen for the front passenger that allows them to control their own climate settings, such as temperature, fan speed, and air distribution. This can provide the front passenger with the ability to adjust their own comfort settings independently of the driver's controls.

Seat Controls: The passenger-side screen may also provide controls for the front passenger to adjust their own seat settings, such as seat heating, cooling, recline, and massage features. This can allow the front passenger to customize their seating comfort during the ride.

Navigation and Maps: Depending on the vehicle's capabilities, the front passenger may be able to access navigation and map features on their side screen, including inputting destinations, viewing maps, and getting turn-by-turn directions. This can provide the front passenger with a visual aid for the trip and allow them to actively participate in the navigation process.

Vehicle Information: The front passenger-side screen may also display vehicle information such as fuel consumption, trip information, and vehicle diagnostics. This can provide the front passenger with insights into the current status of the vehicle and its performance.

Connectivity and Apps: Some vehicles may allow the front passenger to connect their smartphones or other devices to the passenger-side screen, enabling them to access apps, media, and other content during the ride.

It's important to note that not all vehicles have a dedicated screen for the front passenger, and the availability and features of such screens can vary greatly depending on the specific vehicle and its optional equipment. It's recommended to refer to the owner's manual or consult with the manufacturer or dealership for information on the specific features and capabilities of the passenger-side screen in your vehicle.


### Rear Seat Entertainment

Rear seat entertainment screens are often used to provide entertainment options for passengers in the back seats of the car, particularly for long trips. These screens may be mounted on the back of the front seat headrests or integrated into the ceiling or center console of the car. They can provide access to video content, gaming, and other entertainment options, often with individual controls for each screen to allow passengers to customize their experience.





It's important to note that the availability and features of screens in cars can vary depending on the make, model, and trim level of the vehicle. Additionally, the use of screens in cars can vary by local laws and regulations, as some jurisdictions have restrictions on the use of screens while driving to minimize driver distraction and promote road safety. Always follow local laws and regulations when using screens in a car.
