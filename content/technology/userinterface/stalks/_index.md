Stalks are also called “stalk controls” or “column stalks.” They are typically mounted on the side of the steering column and can vary in design and function depending on the make and model of the vehicle.

Here are some common types of stalks found in cars:

**Turn Signal Stalk:** The driver uses this stalk to activate the turn signals, indicating the direction in which the vehicle turns. By pushing the stalk up or down, the driver can activate the left or right turn signal, respectively, and then release it to turn off the signal after completing the turn.

**Headlight Stalk:** This stalk controls the headlights of the vehicle. It typically has multiple positions, allowing the driver to switch between different headlight settings such as low, high, and fog lights. Some headlight stalks also have an “auto” mode, which can automatically control the headlights based on ambient light conditions.

**Windshield Wiper Stalk:**  This stalk the driver uses to control the vehicle's windshield wipers. It typically has multiple settings for controlling the wipers' speed, including intermittent, low, high, and off settings. It may also have controls for the rear wiper if the vehicle is equipped with one.

**Cruise Control Stalk:** If the vehicle is equipped with cruise control, the driver uses this stalk to activate and control the speed of the cruise control system. It typically has buttons to set, adjust, and cancel the cruise control and controls to resume and deactivate it.

Cars with adaptive cruise control often have an adjustment for distance to the vehicle in front.

**Multi-Function Stalks:** Some vehicles may have stalks that combine multiple functions, such as incorporating controls for the turn signals, headlights, and windshield wipers into a single stalk. These multi-function stalks can vary in design and functionality, depending on the vehicle manufacturer and model.

In addition to these common stalks, there may be other stalks or controls on the steering column for functions such as controlling the audio system, adjusting the steering column position, or operating the vehicle's information display.

The specific design and functionality of stalks in cars can vary widely depending on the manufacturer, model, and trim level of the vehicle, as well as regional regulations and market preferences.
