Stalks are also commonly referred to as "stalk controls" or "column stalks". They are typically mounted on the side of the steering column and can vary in design and function depending on the make and model of the vehicle.

Here are some common types of stalks found in cars:

Turn Signal Stalk: This stalk is used to activate the turn signals, indicating the direction in which the vehicle is turning. By pushing the stalk up or down, the driver can activate the left or right turn signal respectively, and then release it to turn off the signal after completing the turn.

Headlight Stalk: This stalk controls the headlights of the vehicle. It typically has multiple positions, allowing the driver to switch between different headlight settings such as low beam, high beam, and fog lights. Some headlight stalks also have an "auto" mode, which can automatically control the headlights based on ambient light conditions.

Windshield Wiper Stalk: This stalk is used to control the windshield wipers of the vehicle. It typically has multiple settings for controlling the speed of the wipers, including settings for intermittent, low, high, and off. It may also have controls for the rear wiper if the vehicle is equipped with one.

Cruise Control Stalk: If the vehicle is equipped with cruise control, this stalk is used to activate and control the speed of the cruise control system. It typically has buttons to set, adjust, and cancel the cruise control, as well as controls to resume and deactivate it.

Multi-Function Stalks: Some vehicles may have stalks that combine multiple functions, such as incorporating controls for the turn signals, headlights, and windshield wipers into a single stalk. These multi-function stalks can vary in design and functionality, depending on the vehicle manufacturer and model.

In addition to these common stalks, there may be other stalks or controls on the steering column for functions such as controlling the audio system, adjusting the steering column position, or operating the vehicle's information display. The specific design and functionality of stalks in cars can vary widely depending on the manufacturer, model, and trim level of the vehicle, as well as regional regulations and market preferences. It's always important to refer to the owner's manual of a specific vehicle for detailed information on the stalk controls and their functions.
