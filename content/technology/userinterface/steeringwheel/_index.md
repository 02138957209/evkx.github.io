It is typically located in front of the driver's seat and is used to manipulate the steering mechanism, which in turn controls the movement of the wheels. Here's everything you need to know about steering wheels in cars:

Design and Construction:

Steering wheels come in various shapes, sizes, and materials. Common shapes include the classic circular design, as well as sportier designs such as D-shaped, flat-bottomed, or contoured shapes.
The size of a steering wheel can vary depending on the make and model of the vehicle, with smaller steering wheels often used in sportier cars for more precise control, while larger steering wheels are commonly found in larger vehicles.
Steering wheels are typically constructed with a metal or plastic core, covered with a soft, grippy material such as leather, synthetic leather, or rubber for better grip and comfort.
Many modern steering wheels also incorporate additional features such as buttons or switches for controlling various functions of the vehicle, such as audio controls, cruise control, phone calls, and more. These buttons or switches are typically located on the steering wheel rim or spokes for easy access while driving.
Functionality:

The primary function of the steering wheel is to allow the driver to control the direction of the vehicle. By turning the steering wheel left or right, the driver can control the movement of the front wheels, which in turn determines the direction the vehicle will travel.
Steering wheels are connected to the vehicle's steering mechanism, which typically consists of a steering column, steering gear, and tie rods, among other components. When the driver turns the steering wheel, it rotates the steering column, which transfers the motion to the steering gear, and ultimately to the front wheels, causing them to turn.
Most modern cars are equipped with power steering, which uses hydraulic or electric assistance to make steering easier, especially at low speeds or when parking. Power steering systems can be either hydraulic, where hydraulic pressure is used to assist the driver's effort, or electric, where an electric motor provides the assistance.
Some vehicles may also have additional steering features such as adjustable steering effort, which allows the driver to customize the amount of steering assistance, or variable-ratio steering, which changes the steering ratio based on the vehicle's speed for improved handling and stability.
Safety:

Steering wheels play a crucial role in vehicle safety. They are typically equipped with a driver-side airbag that can deploy in the event of a collision to protect the driver in conjunction with other safety features such as seat belts and other airbags.
Many modern steering wheels also incorporate controls for audio, phone calls, and other functions, which can help reduce driver distraction by keeping the driver's hands on the wheel and eyes on the road.
It's important for drivers to maintain proper hand placement on the steering wheel to ensure optimal control and safety. The "10 and 2" or "9 and 3" hand positions, where hands are placed on the wheel at the 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock positions, or 9 o'clock and 3 o'clock positions, respectively, are commonly recommended for optimal control and airbag deployment safety.
Overall, the steering wheel is a critical component of a car's steering system, allowing the driver to control the direction of the vehicle and navigate safely on the road. It's important to use the steering wheel properly and follow safe driving practices to ensure safe and effective vehicle operation.
