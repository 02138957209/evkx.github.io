### Screens

One of the most noticeable aspects of the user interface in modern EVs is the screens. These displays can range from small screens displaying basic information to large touchscreens that take up most of the dashboard.

### Head-Up Display

Another technology used in EVs is the head-up display (HUD). The HUD projects essential information, such as speed and navigation, onto the windshield, allowing the driver to keep their eyes on the road while still accessing important data.

### Voice Control

Voice control is another feature that is becoming increasingly popular in EVs. With voice control, drivers can access a range of features, such as navigation, media, and climate control, without taking their hands off the wheel.

### Gesture Control

Gesture control is another technology that is starting to appear in EVs. With gesture control, the driver can use hand movements to control various features, such as adjusting the volume or changing the radio station. 


### Steering wheel

The steering wheel is an important part of the user interface in a car. It is the primary control mechanism that allows the driver to steer the vehicle and control its direction of movement.
