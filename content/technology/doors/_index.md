Doors also integrate side windows for visibility and ventilation, and may have other features such as mirrors, handles, locks, speakers, and storage compartments. Depending on the design and style of the car, doors may vary in size, shape, location, and mechanism.

## Door locations & types

There are different types of doors in cars, depending on how they are attached and opened. Some of the common types are:

### First row door

These are the doors located at the front of the car, usually on both sides of the driver&apos;s seat. They are typically hinged on their front edge and open outward. They are also called driver&apos;s door and passenger&apos;s door.

## Features of Doors in Cars

Doors in cars may have various features that enhance their functionality, convenience, safety, or appearance. Some of the common features are:

### Soft close

This is a feature that automatically pulls the door shut when it is partially closed, preventing slamming or bouncing. It reduces noise and wear and tear on the door mechanism.

### Powered opening

This is a feature that allows the door to be opened or closed by pressing a button or using a remote control, without manual effort. It is usually found on hatchbacks, lids, or sliding doors. Some luxury models like BMW i7 and Mercedes EQS have it available on the first and second row doors.

### Kick sensor

 This is a feature that allows the door to be opened or closed by waving a foot under the bumper or sill of the car, without touching anything. It is useful when carrying items or having dirty hands. Available on rear trunk or liftgate.

### Flush Door handle

A flush door handle on EVs is a type of door handle that is recessed into the door and does not protrude outwards. Electric cars have flush door handles to reduce aerodynamic drag and to give the car a sleeker look. Some styles aim to impress buyers with handles that pop out on approach. They also provide extra security but come with downsides such as reliability, safety concerns, and operation in icy condition
