Doors also integrate side windows for visibility and ventilation, and may have other features such as mirrors, handles, locks, speakers, and storage compartments. Depending on the design and style of the car, doors may vary in size, shape, location, and mechanism.

## Types of Doors in Cars

There are different types of doors in cars, depending on how they are attached and opened. Some of the common types are:

•  Front doors: These are the doors located at the front of the car, usually on both sides of the driver&apos;s seat. They are typically hinged on their front edge and open outward. They are also called driver&apos;s door and passenger&apos;s door.

•  Rear doors: These are the doors located at the rear of the car, usually on both sides of the back seat. They are typically hinged on their rear edge and open outward. They are also called back doors or second-row doors.

•  Hatch: This is a door located at the back of the car, usually covering the cargo area or trunk. It is typically hinged on its top edge and opens upward. It is also called tailgate or liftgate.

•  Lid: This is a door located at the front of the car, usually covering the engine compartment or hood. It is typically hinged on its front edge and opens upward. It is also called bonnet or hood.

•  Hood: This is a term used in some countries to refer to either the lid or the hatch of a car.


Some cars may have other types of doors that have different mechanisms or styles, such as:

•  Scissor doors: These are doors that open vertically instead of horizontally. They are hinged on their bottom edge and rotate upward along a fixed hinge at the front of the door. They are also called lambo doors or wing doors.

•  Gull-wing doors: These are doors that open upward instead of outward. They are hinged on their top edge and swing upward along a fixed hinge at the roof of the car. They are also called falcon doors or butterfly doors.

•  Sliding doors: These are doors that open sideways instead of outward. They slide along a track or rail on the side of the car. They are usually found on minivans or vans.

•  Suicide doors: These are doors that open in the opposite direction of conventional doors. They are hinged on their rear edge and open inward. They are also called coach doors or rear-hinged doors.


## Features of Doors in Cars

Doors in cars may have various features that enhance their functionality, convenience, safety, or appearance. Some of the common features are:

•  Soft close: This is a feature that automatically pulls the door shut when it is partially closed, preventing slamming or bouncing. It reduces noise and wear and tear on the door mechanism.

•  Powered opening: This is a feature that allows the door to be opened or closed by pressing a button or using a remote control, without manual effort. It is usually found on hatchbacks, lids, or sliding doors.

•  Kick sensor: This is a feature that allows the door to be opened or closed by waving a foot under the bumper or sill of the car, without touching anything. It is useful when carrying items or having dirty hands.

•  Door card: This is a panel that covers the inner side of the door, providing insulation, soundproofing, decoration, and functionality. It may have components such as handles, switches, speakers, pockets, armrests, etc.

•  Door handle: This is a device that allows the door to be opened or closed by pulling or pushing it. It may be located on the exterior or interior side of the door, and may have locks or buttons for security or convenience.

•  Door lock: This is a device that prevents the door from being opened from the outside without a key or a code. It may be operated manually or electronically, and may be integrated with the handle or separate from it.

•  Door switch: This is a device that activates or deactivates certain functions when the door is opened or closed, such as interior lights, alarm system, power windows, etc.

•  Glass window: This is a transparent panel that allows visibility and ventilation through the door. It may be fixed or movable, and may have features such as tinting, defrosting, sunroofing, etc.
