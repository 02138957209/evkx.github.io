A glass panel roof allows for natural light and ventilation to enter the car and enhances the aesthetic appeal and spaciousness of the interior.

A glass panel roof can be either fixed or movable. A fixed glass panel roof is permanently attached to the car frame and cannot be opened or closed. A movable glass panel roof can be opened or closed by using a button, a switch or a hand crank. A movable glass panel roof may be considered as an extension of the power window concept.

## Sunroof

The smallest category of glass roof is a sunroof. This is a glass panel placed above first row. This was the type of glass roof available back in the 80 and 90.

Some glass panel roofs may have some additional features, such as:

•  Tinting or coating to reduce glare, heat or UV rays from the sun.
•  Electric motors or regulators to control the movement of the glass panel roof.
•  Safety locks or sensors to prevent unauthorized opening or closing of the glass panel roof.
•  Sun blinds or shades to adjust the amount of light and heat entering the car.

A glass panel roof is a luxury feature that adds value and comfort to
the car. However, it also increases the weight and complexity of the car and may reduce its fuel efficiency and safety. A glass panel roof may also be more prone to leaks, cracks or breakage due to weather conditions, road debris or accidents.
