A glass panel roof allows for natural light and ventilation to enter the car and enhances the aesthetic appeal and spaciousness of the interior.

## Types

A glass panel roof can be either fixed or movable. A fixed glass panel roof is permanently attached to the car frame and cannot be opened or closed. A movable glass panel roof can be opened or closed by using a button, a switch or a hand crank. A movable glass panel roof may be considered as an extension of the power window concept.

### Sunroof

The smallest category of glass roof is a sunroof. This is a glass panel placed above first row. This was the type of glass roof available back in the 80 and 90.
