A glass panel roof allows for natural light and ventilation to enter the car and enhances the aesthetic appeal and spaciousness of the interior.

## Types

A glass panel roof can be either fixed or movable. A fixed glass panel roof is permanently attached to the car frame and cannot be opened or closed. A movable glass panel roof can be opened or closed by using a button, a switch or a hand crank. A movable glass panel roof may be considered as an extension of the power window concept.

### Sunroof

The smallest category of glass roof is a sunroof. This is a glass panel placed above first row. This was the type of glass roof available back in the 80 and 90.

## Blending

The glass used typical protect against sun heat by reflecting most of the UV rays and allowing some of the heat to radiate out through the glass. However, some manufacturers add addional blending to reduce heat or increase privacy.

### Curtains

Curtains for glass roofs on cars are also known as sunshades or sunroofs. They are designed to block the sunlight and heat from entering the vehicle through the glass roof.

### Electrochromic glass

Electrochromic glass roof is a type of that can change its level of tint based on the amount of current running through it.

## Weight & Noise

A glass panel roof is a luxury feature that adds value and comfort to
the car. However, it also increases the weight and complexity of the car and may reduce its fuel efficiency and safety. A glass panel roof may also be more prone to leaks, cracks or breakage due to weather conditions, road debris or accidents.
