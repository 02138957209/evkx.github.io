The search lets you order the EVs in various technical and functional aspects. In addition, you can filter the result based on your criteria. 

Below, you see the sort orders and filters available.

## Sorting

### Brand & Model

This sort order is the default sort order. We base the result on the manufacturer's and model's names.

[See search result](/evsearch/)

### WLTP Range base trim

This sort order sorts the models based on the specific WLTP range for the base trim for the model. Models with the longest range are listed first. Not all models have a WLTP rating.

[See search result](/evsearch/?sortOrder=RangeMinimumWltp)

### WLTP Consumption base trim

This sort order sorts models based on the consumption for the WLTP cycle

[See search result](/evsearch/?sortOrder=WltpBasicConsumption)

### Usable battery

This sorts models based on the usable (net) battery size. To versions with two sorting

- [See search result small -> large](/evsearch/?sortOrder=NetBattery)
- [See search result large -> small](/evsearch/?sortOrder=NetBattery)

### Power

This sort order sort models based on the max power. From large to small.

[See search result](/evsearch/?sortOrder=PowerDesc)

### Top speed

This sort order sorts the EV models based on rated top speed (V-MAX) From large to small.

[See search result](/evsearch/?sortOrder=TopSpeedDesc)

### Max DC Charging

This sorts models based on the rated MAX DC Charging speed.

[See search result](/evsearch/?sortOrder=MaxDCCharging)

### The Average charging speed

The average charging speed defines how long a charging session lasts. You can sort on three different averages.

- [Average Charging speed 0-100%](/evsearch/?sortOrder=AverageChargingSpeedDesc)
- [Average Charging speed 10-100%](/evsearch/?sortOrder=AverageChargingSpeed10100Desc)
- [Average Charging speed 10-80%](/evsearch/?sortOrder=AverageChargingSpeed1080Desc)

### Acceleration

This sort order sorts models based on acceleration time 0 - 100km/h (0-60 mph)

[See search result](/evsearch/?sortOrder=ZeroTo100)

### Calculated 1000 km challenge

Made famous by [Bj√∏rn Nyland](../evreviewers)  and his 1000km driving tests, where he starts with a full battery and times how long it takes to drive 1000km in 120km/h (75mph). Typical, this includes several charging sessions, and the result depends on the model's charging speed and energy consumption since the driving speed is the same.

EVKX offers a theoretical result for all models based on charging curve and consumption.
While the theoretical result comes close to the real-world result for most models, the real-world tests often show how inconsistent charging performance caused by overheating or other limitations can negatively affect the outcome.

If there is a model that can do 1000km without charging, it could drive this distance in 500 minutes. So any time over 500 minutes in the result is time lost for charging.
