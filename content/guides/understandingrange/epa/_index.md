The tests is defined by United States Environmental Protection Agency.

## How is it tested

The EPA test cycles are [defined](https://www.epa.gov/vehicle-and-fuel-emissions-testing/dynamometer-drive-schedules) by EPA and [test procedure](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j1634_202104/) by SAE

There are two estimates in this cycle, the urban estimate represented by the UDDS (Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule) and the highway estimate represented by the HWFET (Highway Fuel Economy Test).

|  | UDDP | HWFET |
|----|----|----|-----|------|-----|
|Duration, Seconds | 1369 | 765 |
|Stop, seconds | 150 | 49 |
| Distance in meter | 3095 | 4756 |
| Percent stop | 18% | 0% |
| Max speed | 56.5 | 76.6 |
| Avg speed w stop | 18.9 | 39.4 |


Before the testing procedure begins, the car is fully charged and left on its own for the night. The battery is depleted with continuous running UDDS and HWFET cycles with a mix of 55% HWFET and 45% UDDS.

The result is adjusted with an adjusment factor (standardf 0.7) to adjust for real world comsumption.  The adjustment factor can be adjusted if manufactor does [additional tests](https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a33824052/adjustment-factor-tesla-uses-for-big-epa-range-numbers/).
