It was developed by the China Automotive Technology & Research Center (CATARC) in 2020, and it is expected to replace the previous test cycle, called the China Automotive Test Cycle (CATC), which was based on the outdated New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). The CLTC aims to provide more realistic and accurate range estimates for EVs in China.

The CLTC consists of four parts: urban, suburban, highway, and extra-highway. The urban part represents city driving with frequent stops and starts, low speeds, and high traffic density. The suburban part represents rural driving with moderate speeds and traffic density. The highway part represents expressway driving with high speeds and low traffic density. The extra-highway part represents high-speed driving with occasional braking and acceleration.

The CLTC has a total duration of 2,400 seconds (40 minutes) and a total distance of 49.5 kilometers (30.8 miles). The average speed of the CLTC is 74.3 km/h (46.2 mph), which is higher than the NEDC's 33.6 km/h (20.9 mph) and lower than the WLTP's 46.6 km/h (29 mph). The maximum speed of the CLTC is 150 km/h (93 mph), which is higher than both the NEDC's 120 km/h (75 mph) and the WLTP's 131 km/h (81 mph).

The CLTC also has more frequent acceleration and deceleration events than the NEDC and the WLTP, reflecting the more dynamic driving behavior of Chinese drivers. The CLTC has 110 acceleration events and 109 deceleration events, compared to the NEDC's 18 acceleration events and 17 deceleration events, and the WLTP's 25 acceleration events and 24 deceleration events.

## How is the CLTC performed?

The CLTC is performed on a dynamometer, which is a device that simulates driving conditions by placing the vehicle on rollers and measuring its performance. The vehicle is tested in a laboratory under controlled temperature, humidity, and pressure conditions.

The testing procedure starts with fully charging the vehicle's battery and leaving it parked overnight. The next day, the vehicle is driven on the dynamometer following the speed profile of the CLTC until the battery is completely depleted or the vehicle cannot maintain a minimum speed of 40 km/h (25 mph). The total distance traveled by the vehicle during the test is recorded as the preliminary range estimate.

However, this estimate is then adjusted by a correction factor to account for variations in driving conditions, such as temperature, terrain, and driver behavior. The correction factor is based on data collected from real-world driving by EV owners in different regions of China. The final range estimate is the product of the preliminary range estimate and the correction factor.

## How does the CLTC compare to other test cycles?

According to Chinese sources, CLTC estimates are mostly higher than both WLTP and NEDC range figures. For example, an electric vehicle that has a 398 km WLTP and a 484 km NEDC range estimate scored more range (509 km) when CLTC testing procedures were followed. This suggests that the CLTC is more generous than other test cycles in estimating EV range.

However, some experts argue that the CLTC is not necessarily unrealistic or inaccurate, but rather reflects the specific characteristics of Chinese roads and drivers. They claim that Chinese drivers tend to drive faster and more aggressively than European drivers, especially on highways and extra-highways. They also point out that China has a large land area with diverse terrain and climate conditions, which can affect EV performance and range.

Therefore, they suggest that the CLTC is more suitable for evaluating EV range in China than other test cycles that are based on foreign driving patterns and environments. They also recommend that consumers should compare EV range estimates based on the same test cycle rather than different ones to avoid confusion and misunderstanding
