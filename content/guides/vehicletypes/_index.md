Electric Vehicles comes in different form and shapes. In this guide, we explain all the options available in the market.

## Sedan

Sedans are four-door cars with separate trunk compartments. They are designed to provide comfort and convenience to passengers and are popular among families and commuters. Sedans, from compact to full-size, come in various sizes and are known for their smooth and quiet ride. They are also more aerodynamic than other car types, which helps improve efficiency compared to SUVs and crossovers.

## Hatchback

Hatchbacks are small, compact cars with a sloping back design for more headroom and cargo space. They typically have two or four doors, and the rear door opens upward to provide access to the cargo area. Hatchbacks are popular for city driving because of their size and efficiency. They are also relatively affordable and easy to park.

## Sport-Utility Veichle (SUV)

SUVs or Sport Utility Vehicles are a type of vehicle that combines the features of a truck and a car. They are typically larger and heavier than other cars and have a higher ground clearance, making them ideal for off-road driving. SUVs come in various sizes, from compact to full-size, and are known for their spacious interiors and powerful engines. They are also available in four-wheel or all-wheel drive, making them suitable for driving in different terrains and weather conditions. In the last ten years, SUVs have taken more and more of the market.

## Crossover

Crossovers blend SUVs and hatchbacks, combining an SUV's spaciousness with a hatchback's maneuverability. They are smaller than SUVs, making them lighter and more fuel-efficient than SUVs. Crossovers typically have a higher ride height than hatchbacks and come with all- or four-wheel drive options. They are ideal for families needing a spacious and versatile vehicle but don't need an SUV-size EV. Manufacturers and others often use the terms SUV and crossover interchangeably, and there is no clear rule when an EV becomes an SUV and not a crossover. In the EVKX database, we typically consider EVs shorter than 470cm a crossover.

## Coupe SUV

Coupe SUVs are a relatively new type of vehicle that combines a coupe's sporty, sleek design of a coupe with elevated ride height and spaciousness. They typically have a sloping roofline that gives them a more aerodynamic look, similar to a coupe. Coupe SUVs are known for their sporty handling and acceleration, as well as their spacious interior and cargo capacity. They are designed for those who want the practicality and versatility of an SUV but with a more stylish and dynamic appearance. Coupe SUVs come in different sizes. However, they can be more expensive than traditional SUVs and may need more headroom and cargo space due to their sleeker design.

## Pickup Truck

Pickup trucks are designed for heavy-duty work and off-road driving. They have an open cargo bed at the back, which makes them ideal for hauling goods and equipment. Pickup trucks come in various sizes, from compact to full-size, and are available in two- and four-wheel drive. They also offer powerful engines and towing capabilities, making them popular among contractors, farmers, and outdoor enthusiasts

They offer a spacious cargo area, making them ideal for families and those transporting large items. Station wagons are also known for their comfortable ride, excellent handling, and good fuel economy. They are available in front-wheel, rear-wheel, and all-wheel drive and come in different sizes.
