## Bjørn Nyland

Bjørn Nyland, or Teslabjørn, is probably the person on the planet driving EVs the longest each year. He tests many models and has a set of standard tests like the 1000km challenge when he starts with a full battery and drives 1000km to verify how much time this takes. This test includes several charging sessions, and the best cars typically charge fast and have low consumption. 

Other standard tests include range tests, banana box tests, interior reviews, headlight tests, and many more. 

Bjørn Nyland has been driving electric for over ten years and is considered the original EV reviewer by many.
