In this article, we'll explore strategies to maximize your EV batteryâ€™s longevity, focusing on practical tips and delving into the differences between Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) and Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) batteries.


Many factors contribute to battery degradation, but the following are the most significant.

### High-Speed Charging

High-speed charging is the single most significant factor that increases battery degradation. Whenever possible, try to charge your EV at home using a slower charger.

### High or Low State of Charge Over a Long Time

Most EVs have a buffer to protect the battery. However, many people mistakenly believe this buffer protects against charging to 100%. In most cases, the buffer is primarily at the bottom to prevent the battery from running empty.

Most EV manufacturers recommend not charging more than 80% on a daily basis. This recommendation is typically shown in the MMI and the user manual.

The graph below shows a generalized stress level depending on the charge level.

Based on this, the optimal charge level is likely between 30% and 70%. However, the exact benefit compared to charging to 100% is difficult to quantify.

The buffers are essentially limits on the maximum and minimum voltage each cell can have. For example, a 4% buffer on top means the voltage on each cell is limited to a maximum of 96% of the maximum voltage.

### Number of Charge Cycles

The number of charge cycles also affects battery degradation. The diagram below shows how the battery degrades based on charging habits.

Based on this, it is best to keep the charging levels around 50%.

### High Temperature

High temperatures can damage the battery. If you live in an area with high temperatures, try to avoid parking your car in direct sunlight for extended periods.
