## Performance

The MG MG4 Electric XPOWER delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 320 kW (435 hp / 429 bhp) and a total torque of 600 Nm (443 lb-ft). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 3.8 seconds and reaches a top speed of 160 km/h (99 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 64 kWh and a net usable capacity of 61,7 kWh, providing an 2,3 kWh buffer (3.6%) for battery protection. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 435 km (270 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 14.2 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 135 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 84 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 27 minutes with an average charging speed at 96 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 3% to 58%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 96 kW, with each charging session taking about 21 minutes and 12 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 21 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 55 minutes. This journey would require four charging stops from 2% to 63%, with a total charging time of 95 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 5 hours and 36 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

MG MG4 Electric XPOWER features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle.


### Suspension

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 150 mm.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 345mm, and the rear discs are 345mm.

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in several modes. The most efficient is [automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive). In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking to reduce speed. You can also enable [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving).

## Exterior

You can choose between 7 different paint colors when ordering this model.



There is only one roof for this model. As an option, you can order this model with large panoramic roof extending from the front to the rear.
