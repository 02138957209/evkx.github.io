## Performance

The MG MG4 Electric Luxury has a maximum power of 150KW (204hp). The total torque is 250nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 7,9 seconds. The top speed is 160 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 64kWh and a net capacity of 61,7kWh, meaning you have a 2,3kWh buffer for protection. (3,6%).  The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 435 km (270 mi).   The consumption is 14,2kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 135kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 195 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 136 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 0% to 100% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 19kW. Each charge session would take 200 minutes and 51 seconds.
