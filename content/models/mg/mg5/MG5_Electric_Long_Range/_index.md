## Performance

The MG MG5 Electric Long Range has a maximum power of 115KW (156hp). The total torque is 280nm. It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 8,3 seconds. The top speed is 185 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 61,1kWh and a net capacity of 57,4kWh, meaning you have a 3,7kWh buffer for protection. (6,1%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc) 

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 400 to 380 km (249-236 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 14.4kWh/100km for the basic version and 15.1kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 87kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 75 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 33 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 8% to 58%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 67kW. Each charge session would take 26 minutes and 50 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 23kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 57 minutes. This trip will require seven charge session(s) charging from 9% to 52%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 157 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 5 hours and 13 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [front](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to park with the front in. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

MG MG5 Electric Long Range has a front-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the front axle. The motor(s) used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/). 

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 115 mm. 

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). 

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in two modes. You can use [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) or you can coast and use the [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal) to regen. 

## Exterior

You can choose between 4 different paint colors when ordering this model. 



There is only one roof for this model.
