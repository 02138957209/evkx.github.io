## Performance

The MG MG5 Electric Long Range has a maximum power of 150KW (204hp). The total torque is 250nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 7,9 seconds. The top speed is 160 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 61,1kWh and a net capacity of 57,4kWh, meaning you have a 3,7kWh buffer for protection. (6,1%). The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 400 to 380 km (249-236 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 14,4kWh/100km for the basic version and 15,1kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 87kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 50 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 23 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 3% to 60% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 96kW. Each charge session would take 20 minutes and 21 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 21kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 56 minutes to drive. This trip will require five charge session(s) charging from 3% to 57%. The total time lost for charging will be 97 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 5 hours and 13 minutes.

## Drivetrain

MG MG5 Electric Long Range has a rear-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the rear axle. 

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 115 mm. 

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). 

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in several modes. The most efficient is [automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive). In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking to reduce speed. You can also enable [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). 

## Exterior

You can choose between 4 different paint colors when ordering this model. 



There is only one roof for this model.

### Safety systems



The MG MG5 Electric Long Range has a [**lane keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

### Driving Automation



With the   level 2 system, you get the following driving automation features. 
- [**Adaptive Cruise control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/adaptivecruisecontrol/) 
- [**Autosteer**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/autosteer/): keeps the car in your lane and slows down if needed in traffic. The system limits how long you can drive without touching the steering wheel. 


## Cargo Capacity and Towing Ability
