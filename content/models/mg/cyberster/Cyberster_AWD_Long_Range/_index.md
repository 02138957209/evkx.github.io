## Performance

The MG Cyberster AWD Long Range packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 400 kW (544 hp / 536 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 725 Nm (535 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 3.2 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 77 kWh and a net usable capacity of 74,4 kWh, providing an 2,6 kWh buffer (3.4%) for battery protection. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

The vehicle's range, according to the [CLTC](../../../../guides/understandingrange/cltc/) (China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle) standard, is 520 km ( miles). he energy consumption is 14.3 kWh/100 km based on the CLTC standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 135 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 101 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 32 minutes with an average charging speed at 96 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 3% to 58%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 100 kW, with each charging session taking about 25 minutes and 33 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 21 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 43 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 2% to 63%, with a total charging time of 83 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 6 hours and 45 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

MG Cyberster AWD Long Range has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle.

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink).
