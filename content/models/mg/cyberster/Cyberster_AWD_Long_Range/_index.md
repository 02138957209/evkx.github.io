## Performance

The MG Cyberster AWD Long Range has a maximum power of 400 KW (544 hp/536 bhp). The total torque is 725 nm (535 ft-lb). It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 3.2 seconds. The top speed is 200 km/h.

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 77kWh and a net capacity of 74,4kWh, meaning you have a 2,6kWh buffer for protection. (3.4%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

The [CLTC range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/cltc/) is 520 km ( miles). The consumption is 14.3kWh/100km for the CLTC standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 135kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 101 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 32 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 3% to 58%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 100kW. Each charge session would take 25 minutes and 33 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 21kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 43 minutes. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 2% to 63%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 83 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 45 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

MG Cyberster AWD Long Range has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle.

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 120 mm.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes).

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in several modes. The most efficient is [automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive). In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking to reduce speed. You can also enable [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving).

## Exterior
