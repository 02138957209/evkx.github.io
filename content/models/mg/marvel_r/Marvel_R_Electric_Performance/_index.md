## Performance

The MG Marvel R Electric Performance offers modest performance with a maximum power of 212 kW (288 hp / 284 bhp) and a total torque of 665 Nm (491 ft-lb). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 4.9 seconds and has a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The electric vehicle features a high-capacity battery with a gross capacity of 75 kWh and a net usable capacity of 70 kWh, providing an 5 kWh buffer (3.6%) for battery protection.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 370 km (230 mi). The consumption is 18.9kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 94 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 114 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 43 minutes with an average charging speed at 69 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 8% to 61%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 63 kW, with each charging session taking about 35 minutes and 7 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 24.5 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 11 hours and 6 minutes. This journey would require five charging stops from 9% to 59%, with a total charging time of 166 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 21 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
