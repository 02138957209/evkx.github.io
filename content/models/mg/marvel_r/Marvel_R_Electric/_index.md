## Performance

The MG Marvel R Electric has a maximum power of 132 KW (180 hp/177 bhp) and a total torque of 410 nm (303 ft-lb). It can sprint from 0 to 100km/h (0 to 62mph) in 7.9 seconds and has a top speed of 160 km/h (99.4 mph).

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 75kWh and a net capacity of 70kWh, meaning you have a 5kWh buffer for protection. (6.7%).

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) is 402 km (250 mi). The consumption is 17.4kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 94kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 114 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 43 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 8% to 61%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 63kW. Each charge session would take 35 minutes and 7 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 23kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 53 minutes. This trip will require five charge session(s) charging from 9% to 55%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 154 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 21 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
