## Performance

The Chevrolet Blazer EV SS has a maximum power of 410KW (557hp). The total torque is 880nm. It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 4 seconds. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 110kWh and a net capacity of 102kWh, meaning you have a 8kWh buffer for protection. (7,3%). 

 The [EPA range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa) is 290 miles (467 km).   The consumption is 2,8mi/kWh for the EPA standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 190kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 176 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 32 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 8% to 65%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss on 120kW. Each charge session would take 29 minutes and 59 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 25kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 35 minutes to drive. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 8% to 57%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 75 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11,5KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 8 hours and 52 minutes. 

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger.  The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
