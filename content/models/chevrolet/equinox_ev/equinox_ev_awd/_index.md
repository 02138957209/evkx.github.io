## Performance

The Chevrolet Equinox EV AWD delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 215 kW (292 hp / 288 bhp) and a total torque of 469 Nm (346 lb-ft). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.9 seconds and reaches a top speed of 210 km/h (131 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 89 kWh and a net usable capacity of 85 kWh, providing an 4 kWh buffer (4.5%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 330 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

According to the [EPA](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) (Environmental Protection Agency) standard, the vehicle has an range of 319 miles (513 km) with an energy consumption rate of 3.8 miles per kWh. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 150 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 71 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 37 minutes with an average charging speed at 97 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 6% to 58%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 101 kW, with each charging session taking about 26 minutes and 23 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 25 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 59 minutes. This journey would require four charging stops from 6% to 55%, with a total charging time of 100 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11.5 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 7 hours and 23 minutes using a home charging setup. For faster charging, you can opt for an optional onboard charger that supports up to 19.2 kW. With this upgrade, you can achieve a full charge from 0 to 100% in just about 4 hours and 25 minutes at home.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
