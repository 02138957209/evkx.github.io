## Performance

The Chevrolet Silverado EV 4WT delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 380 kW (517 hp / 510 bhp) and a total torque of 834 Nm (615 lb-ft). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 4.5 seconds and reaches a top speed of 170 km/h (106 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 240 kWh and a net usable capacity of 215 kWh, providing an 25 kWh buffer (10.4%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 650 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

According to the [EPA](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) (Environmental Protection Agency) standard, the vehicle has an range of 450 miles (724 km) with an energy consumption rate of 2.1 miles per kWh. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 350 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 83 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 34 minutes with an average charging speed at 266 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 58%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 253 kW, with each charging session taking about 29 minutes and 1 seconds.. This exceptionally fast charging capability makes the Chevrolet Silverado EV 4WT one of the most efficient and convenient EVs for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 35 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 8 hours and 52 minutes. This journey would require one charging stops from 0% to 63%, with a total charging time of 32 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 19 hours and 32 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
