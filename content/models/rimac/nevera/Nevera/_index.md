## Performance

The Rimac Nevera delivers a jaw-dropping maximum power of 1400 KW (1904 hp/1877 bhp) and a massive total torque of 2340 Nm (1727 lb-ft). This powerhouse can rocket from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 1.81 seconds, showcasing its astonishing acceleration. Additionally, it achieves a top speed of 412 km/h (256 mph), making it a true marvel of engineering and performance.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 120 kWh and a net usable capacity of 106,8 kWh, providing an 13,2 kWh buffer (11.0%) for battery protection.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 490 km (305 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 21.8 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 500 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 34 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 16 minutes with an average charging speed at 274 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 2% to 71%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 222 kW, with each charging session taking about 20 minutes and 54 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 24 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 8 hours and 56 minutes. This journey would require two charging stops from 3% to 66%, with a total charging time of 37 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 22 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 4 hours and 51 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Rimac Nevera has an all-wheel drive system supported by four motors. One for each wheel. The motor(s) used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 120 mm, and the maximum is 135 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Rimac Nevera. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed.

### Drive modes

The Rimac Nevera lets the user select different [drive modes](../../../../technology/drivemodes/) that affect the car's handling. The driver can choose between 5 modes:

- Range: Balanced steering, low suspension with efficient throttle, and balanced suspension.
- Cruise: Balanced steering, lowest suspension height with balanced throttle and damping.
- Sport: Balanced steering, lowest suspension height with balanced throttle and damping.
- Track: Dynamic steering, low suspension with dynamic throttle and suspension.
- Drift: Dynamic steering, low suspension with dynamic throttle and suspension.


### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [ceramic discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#ceramic-brakes). The front discs are 390mm, and the rear discs are 390mm.

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in two modes. You can use [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) or you can coast and use the [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal) to regen. The system stops the car completely using friction brakes. You can adjust how strong regen you get when you lift the foot. There are two levels.

## Exterior

You can choose between 5 different paint colors when ordering this model.



There is only one roof for this model.

There is only one type of steering wheel available.

## Climate system

There is one climate system available. The  climate system supports only controlling one shared zone for the whole car. This model has not a [heat pump](../../../../technology/hvac/#heat-pump). This can increase consumption in cold weather compared to models with a heat pump.

## Comfort

Rimac Nevera has several features to make your life as a driver or passenger more comfortable.

Keyless entry allows access to the car without needing to find the key. As long you bring it with you, the doors open.

Keyless go makes it possible to start the car without using the key.

In addition, there is one [infotainment screen](../../../../technology/userinterface/screens/#infotainment-screen) in the center console  and one [infotainment screen](../../../../technology/userinterface/screens/#front-passenger-screen) in front of the passenger seat. The  screen behind the steering wheel integrated into the dashboard is 12.3 inches large. The touch screen at the top of the center console is 13.8 inches large. The touch screen in front of the passenger in the dashboard is 8.8 inches large.
The model does not have a head-up display.

## Advanced driver assistance systems

The Rimac Nevera has several standard and optional [advanced driver assistance systems](../../../../technology/driverassistance/)  (ADAS) for better safety and comfort.
### Safety systems



The Rimac Nevera has an [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The Rimac Nevera has a [**lane-keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has a [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

### Driving Automation



With the   level 2 system, you get the following driving automation features.
- [**Adaptive Cruise control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/adaptivecruisecontrol/)
- [**Lane Centering Assist (LCA) /AutoSteer**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/autosteer/): keeps the car in your lane and slows down if needed in traffic. The system limits how long you can drive without touching the steering wheel.
