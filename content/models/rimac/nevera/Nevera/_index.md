## Performance

The Rimac Nevera delivers a jaw-dropping maximum power of 1400 KW (1904 hp/1877 bhp) and a massive total torque of 2340 Nm (1727 lb-ft). This powerhouse can rocket from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 1.81 seconds, showcasing its astonishing acceleration. Additionally, it achieves a top speed of 412 km/h (256 mph), making it a true marvel of engineering and performance.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 120 kWh and a net usable capacity of 106,8 kWh, providing an 13,2 kWh buffer (11.0%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 630 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 490 km (305 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 21.8 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 500 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 34 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 16 minutes with an average charging speed at 274 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 2% to 71%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 222 kW, with each charging session taking about 20 minutes and 54 seconds.. This exceptionally fast charging capability makes the Rimac Nevera one of the most efficient and convenient EVs for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 24 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 8 hours and 56 minutes. This journey would require two charging stops from 3% to 66%, with a total charging time of 37 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 22 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 4 hours and 51 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

Rimac Nevera has an all-wheel drive system supported by four motors. One for each wheel. The motors used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The front suspension employs a [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone) design, while the rear uses a [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink) setup. The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 120 mm, and the maximum is 135 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Rimac Nevera. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed.

### Drive modes

The Rimac Nevera lets the user select different [drive modes](../../../../technology/drivemodes/) that affect the car's handling. The driver can choose between 5 modes:

- Range: Balanced steering, low suspension with efficient throttle, and balanced suspension.
- Cruise: Balanced steering, lowest suspension height with balanced throttle and damping.
- Sport: Balanced steering, lowest suspension height with balanced throttle and damping.
- Track: Dynamic steering, low suspension with dynamic throttle and suspension.
- Drift: Dynamic steering, low suspension with dynamic throttle and suspension.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [ceramic discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#ceramic-brakes). The front discs are 390mm, and the rear discs are 390mm.

### Regenerative braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in two modes. You can use [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) or you can coast and use the [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal) to regen. The system stops the car completely using friction brakes.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are two levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

The maximum regenerative power is 400 kW.

## Exterior

The Rimac Nevera is available in a total of 5 paint colors, including several striking metallic options.

You can select from multiple wheel designs, all available in the same size, on the Rimac Nevera, allowing you to personalize your vehicle to match your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 275/35 tires on 20" rims front and 315/35 tires on 20" rims rear



There is only one roof for this model.
