## Performance

The CUPRA BORN 58 has a maximum power of 150KW (204hp). The total torque is 310nm. It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 7,3 seconds. The top speed is 160 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 62kWh and a net capacity of 58kWh, meaning you have a 4kWh buffer for protection. (6,5%). 

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) varies from 424 to 358 km (264-222 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 13.7kWh/100km for the basic version and 16.2kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 120kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 63 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 34 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 0% to 43%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 77kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 28 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 22kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 26 minutes. This trip will require seven charge session(s) charging from 0% to 40%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 127 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 5 hours and 16 minutes. 

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

CUPRA BORN 58 has a rear-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the rear axle. The motor(s) used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/). 

The standard suspension has steel springs with a fixed height but an optional damping adjustment. The ground clearance with this suspension is 131 mm. 

### Steering

Dynamic steering is an optional feature on the CUPRA BORN 58. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. 

### Brakes



[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in several modes. The most efficient is [automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive). In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking to reduce speed. You can also enable [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). 

## Exterior

You can choose between 5 different paint colors when ordering this model. 
Additionally, you can choose between 6 wheels with sizes from 18 to 20 inches. 

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). 

You can choose between two types of roofs on this model. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a large panoramic roof extending over most of the areas from the front to the rear. This glass makes the carâ€™s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

You can order the car with tinted windows from B-pillar and back.
