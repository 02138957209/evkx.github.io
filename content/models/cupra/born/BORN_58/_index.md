## Performance

The CUPRA BORN 58 has a maximum power of 150KW (204hp). The total torque is 310nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 7,3 seconds. The top speed is 160 kph. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 62kWh and a net capacity of 58kWh, meaning you have a 4kWh buffer for protection. (6,5%). Depending on car options, the [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 424 to 358 km (264-222 mi). Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 13,7kWh/100km for the basic version and 16,2kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 120kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 63 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 34 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 0% to 43% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 77kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 28 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 22kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 26 minutes to drive. This will requires seven charge sessions charging from 0% to 40%. The total time lost for charging will be 127 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 5 hours and 16 minutes. 

## Drivetrain

The standard suspension has steel springs with a fixed height but an optional damping adjustment. The ground clearance with this suspension is 131 mm. 

### Steering

Dynamic steering is optional on CUPRA BORN 58. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. 

### Brakes
