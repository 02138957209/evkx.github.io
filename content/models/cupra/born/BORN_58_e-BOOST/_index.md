## Performance

With overboost, the CUPRA BORN 58 e-BOOST has a maximum power of 170KW (231hp). Without overboost, it is 150KW (204hp). The torque is 310nm with overboost and 310 without overboost. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 6,6 seconds with overboost and 7,3 seconds without overboost. The top speed is 160 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 62kWh and a net capacity of 58kWh, meaning you have a 4kWh buffer for protection. (6,5%). The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 420 to 362 km (261-225 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 13,8kWh/100km for the basic version and 16,0kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 120kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 63 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 34 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 0% to 43% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 77kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 28 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 22kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 26 minutes to drive. This trip will require seven charge session(s) charging from 0% to 40%. The total time lost for charging will be 127 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 5 hours and 16 minutes.

## Drivetrain

CUPRA BORN 58 e-BOOST has a rear-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the rear axle. The motor(s) used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/). 

The standard suspension has steel springs with a fixed height but an optional damping adjustment. The ground clearance with this suspension is 131 mm. 

### Steering

Dynamic steering is optional on the CUPRA BORN 58 e-BOOST. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. 

### Brakes



[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in several modes. The most efficient is [automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive). In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking to reduce speed. You can also enable [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). 

## Exterior

You can choose between 5 different paint colors when ordering this model. 
Additionally, you can choose between 6 wheels with sizes from 18 to 20 inches. 

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). 

You can choose between two types of roofs on this model. The standard is just a regular roof. The optional has a panoramic roof. You can not open the panoramic roof but can block the light with a curtain.  

You can order the car with tinted windows from B-pillar and back.

## Advanced driver assistance systems

The CUPRA BORN 58 e-BOOST has several standard and optional [advanced driver assistance systems](../../../../technology/driverassistance/)  (ADAS) for better safety and comfort.

[**Efficiency assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/efficencyassist/) is a standard system that helps the driver to drive preemptively and save energy. 
### Safety systems



The CUPRA BORN 58 e-BOOST has a [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The CUPRA BORN 58 e-BOOST has a [**Electronic Stability Control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/electronicstabilitycontrol/)  as a standard system that is designed to improve the stability and handling of a vehicle during sudden maneuvers or slippery road conditions.

The CUPRA BORN 58 e-BOOST has a [**lane keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Front Cross Traffic Assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/frontcrosstrafficassist/) is a standard driver assist system that helps drivers detect oncoming traffic when crossing an intersection or turning left or right from a stopped position. 

[**Forward Collision Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/) is a standard driver assist system that is designed to help drivers avoid or mitigate frontal collisions. 

The CUPRA BORN 58 e-BOOST has a [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/)  as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.

[**Automatic emergency steering**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencysteering/) is a standard  driver assist system designed to help drivers avoid collisions by automatically steering the vehicle in an emergency. 

[**Blind spot monitoring**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/blindspotmonitoring/) is a optional driver assist system. This side assist system helps to detect traffic in blind spots. 

### Driving Automation

The CUPRA BORN 58 e-BOOST offers [driving automation on level 1 or 2](../../../../technology/driverassistance/#level-of-autonomous-driving), depending on the equipment level.

With the standard system the model offers no driving automation. 
- Cruise control. 


With the   level 1 system, you get thadditional driving automation features to the ones listed above. 
- [**Adaptive Cruise control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/adaptivecruisecontrol/) 


With the Assistantpackage plus  level 2 system, you get additional driving automation features to the ones listed above. 
- [**Autosteer**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/autosteer/): keeps the car in your lane and slows down if needed in traffic. The system limits how long you can drive without touching the steering wheel. 
- [**Automatic parking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticparking/). (optional) 


## Cargo Capacity and Towing Ability

The cargo capacity in the trunk is 385 liters. With the rear seat down, it is 1267 liters. On the roof, you can load up to 0kg. Max weight is 2280kg, and with the base weight of 1785 kg, you can max load 495 kg, including driver and passengers. Some options can increase the base weight and reduce the max loading weight. 

This model is not available with a towbar. So if you need to pull a trailer, you must look at other models.
