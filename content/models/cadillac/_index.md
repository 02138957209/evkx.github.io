Cadillac's electric vehicle (EV) strategy is part of GM's vision to create a world with zero crashes, zero emissions, and zero congestion. GM plans to launch 30 new EVs globally by 2025, with Cadillac being the lead brand for electrification. Cadillac aims to exclusively sell all-electric vehicles by 2030, making it GM's luxury EV brand.<br /><br />Some of the key elements of Cadillac's EV strategy are:<br />- Developing a new EV platform called Ultium that will offer a range of battery options, vehicle configurations, and driving modes. Ultium batteries are expected to offer an electric driving range of 400 miles or more on a single charge<br />- Introducing new EV models that will showcase Cadillac's design, technology, and performance capabilities. Some of the upcoming models include the Lyriq crossover, the Celestiq sedan, the Escalade IQ SUV, and the Symboliq coupe.<br> - Leveraging GM's connectivity, ridesharing, car sharing, and autonomous driving capabilities to offer new mobility solutions for customers. Cadillac also plans to offer Super Cruise, a hands-free driver assistance system, on all of its models by 2023.<br /> - Expanding its global presence, especially in China, which is the world's largest EV market. Cadillac expects China to account for more than half of its global sales by 2025.<br />Cadillac's EV strategy is ambitious and challenging, but it also reflects the brand's commitment to innovation and excellence. Cadillac hopes to attract new customers and retain loyal fans with its electrified portfolio of vehicles that will redefine luxury and performance in the EV era.
