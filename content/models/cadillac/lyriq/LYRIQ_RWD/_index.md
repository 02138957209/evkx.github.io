## Performance

The Cadillac LYRIQ RWD has a maximum power of 373KW (507hp). The total torque is 610nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 4,7 seconds. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 110kWh and a net capacity of 102kWh, meaning you have a 8kWh buffer for protection. (7,3%).

The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 203 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 37 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 16% to 72% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 108kW. Each charge session would take 32 minutes and 37 seconds. 

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the standard onboard charger supports up to 11,5KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 8 hours and 52 minutes.
