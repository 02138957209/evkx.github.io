The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 199 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 36 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 16% to 72% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 108kW. Each charge session would take 31 minutes and 6 seconds.
