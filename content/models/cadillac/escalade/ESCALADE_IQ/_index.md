## Performance

The Cadillac ESCALADE IQ has a maximum power of 560KW (761hp). The total torque is 1064nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 4,7 seconds. The top speed is 200 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 215kWh and a net capacity of 200kWh, meaning you have a 15kWh buffer for protection. (7,0%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc) 

 The [EPA range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa) is 450 miles (724 km).   The consumption is 2,3mi/kWh for the EPA standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 350kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 130 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 45 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 53% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 242kW. Each charge session would take 26 minutes and 49 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 35kWh/100km, 1000km will take 8 hours and 58 minutes to drive. This trip will require two charge session(s) charging from 1% to 39%. The total time lost for charging will be 39 minutes.   

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 19,2KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 10 hours and 25 minutes. 

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This makes it easy for charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Cadillac ESCALADE IQ has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motor(s) used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/). 

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 125 mm, and the max is 200 mm. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is standard. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.  

### Brakes



[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available through [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal). [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. 

## Exterior

You can choose between 1 different paint colors when ordering this model. 

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). Powered doors are an standard function for the side doors. 

There is only one roof for this model. As an option, you can order this model with a large panoramic roof extending from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car's interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.
