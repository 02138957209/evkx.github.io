## Performance

The YangWang U9 has a maximum power of 960 KW (1305 hp/1287 bhp). The total torque is 1600 nm (1181 ft-lb). It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 2 seconds. The top speed is 300 km/h.

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 100kWh and a net capacity of 98kWh, meaning you have a 2kWh buffer for protection. (2,0%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [LFP technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp) This has some benefits and disadvantages from the typical NCA/NCM batteries.

The [CLTC range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/cltc/) is 700 km ( miles). The consumption is 14.0kWh/100km for the CLTC standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 200kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 54 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 28 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 2% to 67%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 135kW. Each charge session would take 28 minutes and 17 seconds.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 22 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 4 hours and 27 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

YangWang U9 has an all-wheel drive system supported by four motors. One for each wheel. The motor(s) used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 120 mm, and the maximum is 120 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the YangWang U9. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed.

### Drive modes

The YangWang U9 lets the user select different [drive modes](../../../../technology/drivemodes/) that affect the car's handling. The driver can choose between 5 modes:

- Range: Balanced steering, low suspension with efficient throttle, and balanced suspension.
- Cruise: Balanced steering, lowest suspension height with balanced throttle and damping.
- Sport: Balanced steering, lowest suspension height with balanced throttle and damping.
- Track: Dynamic steering, low suspension with dynamic throttle and suspension.
- Drift: Dynamic steering, low suspension with dynamic throttle and suspension.


### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [ceramic discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#ceramic-brakes). The front discs are 390mm, and the rear discs are 390mm.

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in two modes. You can use [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) or you can coast and use the [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal) to regen. The system stops the car completely using friction brakes. You can adjust how strong regen you get when you lift the foot. There are two levels.

## Exterior

You can choose between 5 different paint colors when ordering this model.
