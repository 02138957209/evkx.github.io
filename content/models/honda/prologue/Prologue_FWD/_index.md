## Performance

The Honda Prologue FWD has a maximum power of 158 KW (215 hp/212 bhp). The total torque is 320 nm (236 ft-lb). It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 7,5 seconds.

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 89kWh and a net capacity of 85kWh, meaning you have a 4kWh buffer for protection. (4,5%).

The [EPA range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) is 296 miles (476 km). The consumption is 3.5mi/kWh for the EPA standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 150kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 66 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 32 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 6% to 56%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 102kW. Each charge session would take 25 minutes and 56 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 25kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 57 minutes. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 6% to 55%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 98 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11,5 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 23 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
