## Performance

The Honda e:Ny1 has a maximum power of 150KW (204hp). The total torque is 310nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 7,7 seconds. The top speed is 160 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 68,8kWh and a net capacity of 61,9kWh, meaning you have a 6,9kWh buffer for protection. (10,0%). 

 The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 412 km (256 mi).   The consumption is 15,0kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 119 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 77 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 0% to 39% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 36kW. Each charge session would take 40 minutes and 44 seconds. 

### Onboard charger



### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [front](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front). This makes it easy for charge stations where you need to park with the front in.
