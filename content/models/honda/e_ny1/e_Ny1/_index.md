## Performance

The Honda e:Ny1 has a maximum power of 150KW (204hp). The total torque is 310nm. It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 7,7 seconds. The top speed is 160 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 68,8kWh and a net capacity of 61,9kWh, meaning you have a 6,9kWh buffer for protection. (10,0%). 

 The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 412 km (256 mi).   The consumption is 15.0kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 59 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 38 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 6% to 92%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 62kW. Each charge session would take 51 minutes and 28 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 24,5kWh/100km, 1000km will take 11 hours and 18 minutes. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 16% to 90%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 179 minutes.

### Onboard charger



### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [front](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to park with the front in.
