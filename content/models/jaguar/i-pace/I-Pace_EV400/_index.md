## Performance

The Jaguar I-Pace EV400 delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 294 kW (400 hp / 394 bhp) and a total torque of 696 Nm (514 lb-ft). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 4.8 seconds and reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 90 kWh and a net usable capacity of 84,7 kWh, providing an 5,3 kWh buffer (5.9%) for battery protection.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 470 to 408 km (292-254 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels, for instance, can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 18.0 kWh/100 km for the base model and 20.8 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 104 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 105 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 49 minutes with an average charging speed at 72 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 7% to 46%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 76 kW, with each charging session taking about 26 minutes and 2 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 26.9 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 47 minutes. This journey would require five charging stops from 6% to 50%, with a total charging time of 148 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 7 hours and 42 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
