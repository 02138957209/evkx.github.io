We also have an overview of the [full specifications](specifications/), an [image gallery](gallery/), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve/), and some [online reviews](reviews/).

## Performance

The Jaguar I-Pace EV400 has a maximum power of 294KW (400hp). The total torque is 696nm. It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 4,8 seconds. The top speed is 200 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 90kWh and a net capacity of 84,7kWh, meaning you have a 5,3kWh buffer for protection. (5,9%). 

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) varies from 470 to 408 km (292-254 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 18.0kWh/100km for the basic version and 20.8kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 104kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 105 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 49 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 7% to 46%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 76kW. Each charge session would take 26 minutes and 2 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 26,9kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 47 minutes. This trip will require five charge session(s) charging from 6% to 50%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 148 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 7KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 12 hours and 6 minutes.
