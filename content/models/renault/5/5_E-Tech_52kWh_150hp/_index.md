## Performance

The Renault 5 E-Tech 52kWh 150hp offers modest performance with a maximum power of 110 kW (150 hp / 148 bhp) and a total torque of 245 Nm (181 ft-lb). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 7.9 seconds and has a top speed of 150 km/h (93 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 55kWh and a net capacity of 52kWh, meaning you have a 3kWh buffer for protection. (5.5%).

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) is 400 km (249 mi). The consumption is 13.0kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 100kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 68 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 29 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 5% to 58%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 69kW. Each charge session would take 24 minutes and 2 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 19.9kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 29 minutes. This trip will require five charge session(s) charging from 4% to 61%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 130 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the standard onboard charger supports up to 7.2 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 13 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
