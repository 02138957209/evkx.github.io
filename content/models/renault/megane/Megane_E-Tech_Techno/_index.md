## Performance

The Renault Megane E-Tech Techno has a maximum power of 160KW (218hp). The total torque is 300nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 8,4 seconds. The top speed is 170 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 65kWh and a net capacity of 60kWh, meaning you have a 5kWh buffer for protection. (7,7%). 

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 450 to 429 km (280-267 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 13,3kWh/100km for the basic version and 14,0kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 130kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 73 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 37 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 43% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 73kW. Each charge session would take 21 minutes and 49 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 19,9kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 16 minutes to drive. This trip will require six charge session(s) charging from 1% to 40%. The total time lost for charging will be 116 minutes.   

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the standard onboard charger supports up to 7,2KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 8 hours and 20 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger.  The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
