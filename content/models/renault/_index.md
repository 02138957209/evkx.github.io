Renault's EV strategy is based on six pillars: - Batteries: Renault aims to master the NMC chemistry and produce one million battery units by 2030, in collaboration with the Alliance and other partners. -  Powertrain: Renault plans to source and manufacture its own e-powertrain, which is the combination of the electric motor, the inverter, and the gearbox. This will reduce costs and increase efficiency.- EV-native platforms: Renault will use dedicated EV platforms that are designed to optimize range, performance, and comfort. The CMF-EV platform will be used for the Mégane E-TECH Electric and other models, while the CMF-BEV platform will be used for the 5 Prototype and other models.- Operations: Renault will make competitive electric vehicles in France, by creating the ElectriCity division that combines three plants in northern France. This division will produce 400,000 EVs per year by 2025 and create an ecosystem of suppliers and partners.- Battery lifecycle: Renault will generate additional value from the batteries throughout their lifecycle, by offering services such as battery leasing, second-life applications, recycling, and circular economy. - Line-up: Renault will launch 10 new electric vehicles by 2025, including the reborn 5 Prototype, the 4ever (a modern Renault 4), and the Mégane E-TECH Electric. Renault aims to have 65% of its sales mix in Europe be electric by 2025 and 90% by 2030. Renault's EV strategy is part of its Renaulution plan, which is a historic transformation of the Group to become a next-gen automotive company. Renault's vision is to offer competitive, sustainable, and popular electric vehicles that meet the needs and expectations of customers and society.
