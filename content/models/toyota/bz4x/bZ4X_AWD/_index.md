## Performance

The Toyota bZ4X AWD has a maximum power of 160KW (218hp). The total torque is 337nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 6,9 seconds. The top speed is 160 kph. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 71,4kWh and a net capacity of 64kWh, meaning you have a 7,4kWh buffer for protection. (10,4%). Depending on car options, the [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 470 to 415 km (292-258 mi). Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 13,6kWh/100km for the basic version and 15,4kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 100kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 163 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 67 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 0% to 32% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 55kW. Each charge session would take 22 minutes and 9 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 22kWh/100km, 1000km will take 11 hours and 9 minutes to drive. This will requires seven charge sessions charging from 0% to 35%. The total time lost for charging will be 170 minutes.
