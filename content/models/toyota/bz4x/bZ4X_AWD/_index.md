## Performance

The Toyota bZ4X AWD offers modest performance with a maximum power of 160 kW (218 hp / 215 bhp) and a total torque of 337 Nm (249 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 6.9 seconds and has a top speed of 160 km/h (99 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 71,4 kWh and a net usable capacity of 58 kWh, providing an 13,4 kWh buffer (18.8%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 355.2 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 470 to 415 km (292-258 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels, for instance, can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 12.3 kWh/100 km for the base model and 14.0 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 147 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 74 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 34 minutes with an average charging speed at 71 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 2% to 50%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 78 kW, with each charging session taking about 21 minutes and 27 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 23 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 34 minutes. This journey would require six charging stops from 1% to 51%, with a total charging time of 134 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 6.6 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 8 hours and 47 minutes using a home charging setup. For faster charging, you can opt for an optional onboard charger that supports up to 11 kW. With this upgrade, you can achieve a full charge from 0 to 100% in just about 5 hours and 16 minutes at home.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
