## Performance

The Toyota bZ4X AWD has a maximum power of 160KW (218hp). The total torque is 337nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 6,9 seconds. The top speed is 160 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 71,4kWh and a net capacity of 64kWh, meaning you have a 7,4kWh buffer for protection. (10,4%). The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 470 to 415 km (292-258 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 13,6kWh/100km for the basic version and 15,4kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 147kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 141 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 34 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 3% to 47% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 88kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 9 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 23kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 14 minutes to drive. This trip will require five charge session(s) charging from 1% to 53%. The total time lost for charging will be 115 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the standard onboard charger supports up to 6,6KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 9 hours and 41 minutes. You can also select an optional onboard charger that supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 5 hours and 49 minutes. 

## Drivetrain

Toyota bZ4X AWD has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. 

The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 177 mm.

### Safety systems



The Toyota bZ4X AWD has a [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

[**Forward Collision Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/) is a standard driver assist system that is designed to help drivers avoid or mitigate frontal collisions. 

The Toyota bZ4X AWD has a [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/)  as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.

[**Automatic emergency steering**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencysteering/) is a standard  driver assist system designed to help drivers avoid collisions by automatically steering the vehicle in an emergency. 

[**Blind spot monitoring**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/blindspotmonitoring/) is a optional driver assist system. This side assist system helps to detect traffic in blind spots. 

### Driving Automation



With the standard system the model offers no driving automation. 
- [**Adaptive Cruise control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/adaptivecruisecontrol/)
