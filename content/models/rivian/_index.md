Rivian also has a contract with Amazon to deliver 100,000 electric delivery vans by 2030. Rivian's EV strategy is supported by its access to capital, its partnerships with Ford and Amazon, its in-house battery and motor technology, and its network of charging stations and service centers. Rivian is seen by some analysts as a potential challenger to Tesla, the EV market leader, as it offers a different value proposition and targets a different customer segment.
