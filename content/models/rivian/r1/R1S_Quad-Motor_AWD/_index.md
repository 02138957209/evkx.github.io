## Performance

The Rivian R1S Quad-Motor AWD has a maximum power of 620KW (843hp). The total torque is 1231nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 3,1 seconds. The top speed is 201 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 135kWh and a net capacity of 125kWh, meaning you have a 10kWh buffer for protection. (7,4%). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 104 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 42 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 0% to 45% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 138kW. Each charge session would take 25 minutes and 30 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 30kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 36 minutes to drive. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 0% to 47%. The total time lost for charging will be 77 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11,5KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 10 hours and 52 minutes.

### Safety systems



The Rivian R1S Quad-Motor AWD has a [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The Rivian R1S Quad-Motor AWD has a [**Electronic Stability Control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/electronicstabilitycontrol/)  as a standard system that is designed to improve the stability and handling of a vehicle during sudden maneuvers or slippery road conditions.

The Rivian R1S Quad-Motor AWD has a [**lane keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Front Cross Traffic Assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/frontcrosstrafficassist/) is a standard driver assist system that helps drivers detect oncoming traffic when crossing an intersection or turning left or right from a stopped position. 

[**Forward Collision Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/) is a standard driver assist system that is designed to help drivers avoid or mitigate frontal collisions. 

The Rivian R1S Quad-Motor AWD has a [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/)  as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.

[**Blind spot monitoring**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/blindspotmonitoring/) is a standard driver assist system. This side assist system helps to detect traffic in blind spots. 

### Driving Automation



With the Driver+  level 2 system, you get the following driving automation features.
