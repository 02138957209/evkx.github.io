## Performance

The Rivian R1S Quad-Motor AWD has a maximum power of 620 KW (843 hp/831 bhp). The total torque is 1231 nm (908 ft-lb). It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 3.1 seconds. The top speed is 201 km/h.

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 135kWh and a net capacity of 125kWh, meaning you have a 10kWh buffer for protection. (7.4%).

The [EPA range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) varies from 321 to 289 miles (516-465 km), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range. The consumption is between 2.6mi/kWh for the basic version and 2.3mi/kWh for the top trim version for the EPA standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 104 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 42 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 0% to 45%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 138kW. Each charge session would take 25 minutes and 30 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 30kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 36 minutes. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 0% to 47%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 77 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11.5 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 10 hours and 52 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front corner](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-corner). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to park with the front in. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Rivian R1S Quad-Motor AWD has an all-wheel drive system supported by four motors. One for each wheel.

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 205 mm, and the maximum is 365 mm.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 343mm, and the rear discs are 328mm.

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available through [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) or coasting is not available in this model. The system stops the car completely using friction brakes. You can adjust how strong regen you get when you lift the foot. There are two levels.

## Exterior

You can choose between 9 different paint colors when ordering this model.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [split tailgate](../../../../technology/doors/#split-tailgate) where the bottom part falls and the top part lifts.

There is only one roof for this model. As an option, you can order this model with a panoramic roof. The glass has two panels. One over the first and the second rows. This glass makes the carâ€™s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. Both glass panels have an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted.

### Safety systems



The Rivian R1S Quad-Motor AWD has an [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The Rivian R1S Quad-Motor AWD has an [**Electronic Stability Control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/electronicstabilitycontrol/)  as a standard system designed to improve a vehicle's stability and handling during sudden maneuvers or slippery road conditions.

The Rivian R1S Quad-Motor AWD has a [**lane-keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has a [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Front Cross Traffic Assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/frontcrosstrafficassist/) is a standard driver assist system that helps drivers detect oncoming traffic when crossing an intersection or turning left or right from a stopped position.

[**Forward Collision Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/) is a standard driver assist system to help drivers avoid or mitigate frontal collisions.

The Rivian R1S Quad-Motor AWD has [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/) as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.

[**Blind-spot monitoring**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/blindspotmonitoring/) is a standard driver-assist system. This side assist system helps to detect traffic in blind spots.

### Driving Automation



With the Driver+  level 2 system, you get the following driving automation features.
