## Performance

The Rivian R1S Quad-Motor AWD has a maximum power of 620KW (843hp). The total torque is 1231nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 3,1 seconds. The top speed is 201 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 135kWh and a net capacity of 125kWh, meaning you have a 10kWh buffer for protection. (7,4%). The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 300 to 250 km (186-155 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 41,7kWh/100km for the basic version and 50,0kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 104 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 42 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 0% to 45% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 138kW. Each charge session would take 25 minutes and 30 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 30kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 36 minutes to drive. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 0% to 47%. The total time lost for charging will be 77 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11,5KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 10 hours and 52 minutes.
