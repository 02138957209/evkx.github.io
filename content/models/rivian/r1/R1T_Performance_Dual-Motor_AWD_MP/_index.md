## Performance

The Rivian R1T Performance Dual-Motor AWD MP has a maximum power of 495KW (673hp). The total torque is 1124nm. It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 3,5 seconds. The top speed is 201 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 149kWh and a net capacity of 142,3kWh, meaning you have a 6,7kWh buffer for protection. (4,5%). 

 The [EPA range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) is 410 miles (660 km).   The consumption is 2.9mi/kWh for the EPA standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 113 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 46 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 0% to 45%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 141kW. Each charge session would take 27 minutes and 12 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 30kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 28 minutes. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 0% to 37%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 68 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11,5KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 12 hours and 22 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front corner](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-corner). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to park with the front in. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

[Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) or coasting is not available in this model. The system stops the car completely using friction brakes. You can adjust how strong regen you get when you lift the foot. There are two levels.

## Exterior

You can choose between 9 different paint colors when ordering this model. 

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [tailgate](../../../../technology/doors/#split-tailgate) where the gate falls down. The tailgate is electric powered. 

There is only one roof for this model. As an option, you can order this model with a large panoramic roof extending from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car's interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted.
