## Performance

The BMW i7 M70 xDrive has a maximum power of 485KW (659hp). The total torque is 1015nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 3,7 seconds. The top speed is 250 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 105,7kWh and a net capacity of 101,7kWh, meaning you have a 4,0kWh buffer for protection. (3,8%). The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 560 to 488 km (348-303 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 18,2kWh/100km for the basic version and 20,8kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 195kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 56 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 30 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 2% to 53% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 135kW. Each charge session would take 23 minutes and 4 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 26kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 30 minutes to drive. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 2% to 54%. The total time lost for charging will be 71 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 9 hours and 14 minutes.

## Drivetrain

BMW i7 M70 xDrive has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motor(s) used are [Wound-Rotor Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/wrsm/). 

The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 193 mm, and the max is 223 mm. 

### Steering

Dynamic steering is standard on the BMW i7 M70 xDrive. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is standard. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.  

### Brakes



[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in several modes. The most efficient is [automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive). In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking to reduce speed. You can also enable [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). 

## Exterior

You can choose between 12 different paint colors when ordering this model. 

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). Soft close are an optional function for the regular doors. 

You can choose between two types of roofs on this model. The standard is just a regular roof. The optional has a panoramic roof. You can open the panoramic roof and have the possibility to block the light with a curtain.  

You can order the car with tinted windows from B-pillar and back.

### Safety systems



The BMW i7 M70 xDrive has an [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The BMW i7 M70 xDrive has an [**Electronic Stability Control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/electronicstabilitycontrol/)  as a standard system designed to improve a vehicle's stability and handling during sudden maneuvers or slippery road conditions. 

The BMW i7 M70 xDrive has a [**lane-keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has a [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Rear Cross Traffic Alert**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/rearcrosstrafficalert/) is a optional driver assist system that uses sensors to detect approaching vehicles from the side when backing out of a parking space or driveway. 

[**Forward Collision Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/) is a optional driver assist system to help drivers avoid or mitigate frontal collisions. 

The BMW i7 M70 xDrive has an [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/)  as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.
