We also have an overview of the [full specifications](specifications), an [image gallery](gallery), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve), and some [online reviews](reviews).

## Performance

The BMW i5 M60 xDrive has a maximum power of 442KW (601hp). The total torque is 795nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 3,8 seconds. The top speed is 230 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 84,4kWh and a net capacity of 81,2kWh, meaning you have a 3,2kWh buffer for protection. (3,8%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc) 

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 516 to 455 km (321-283 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 15,7kWh/100km for the basic version and 17,8kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 205kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 56 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 29 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 3% to 50% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 118kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 26 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 22kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 31 minutes to drive. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 3% to 46%. The total time lost for charging will be 71 minutes.   

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the standard onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 22 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This makes it easy for charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

BMW i5 M60 xDrive has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motor(s) used are [Wound-Rotor Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/wrsm/). 

The  suspension has adaptive damping on the front and rear axle and air suspension on the rear axle that automatically keeps the car leveled depending on cargo weight. The ground clearance with this suspension is 136 mm. 

### Steering

Dynamic steering is standard on the BMW i5 M60 xDrive. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is standard. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.  

### Brakes



[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in several modes. The most efficient is [automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive). In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking to reduce speed. You can also enable [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). 

## Exterior

You can choose between 12 different paint colors when ordering this model. 
Additionally, you can choose between 6 wheels with sizes from 19 to 20 inches. 

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [boot lid](../../../../technology/doors/#boot-lid) for the trunk. Soft close are an optional function for the regular doors. 

You can choose between two types of roofs on this model. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a large panoramic roof extending over most of the areas from the front to the rear. This glass makes the carâ€™s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

You can order the car with tinted windows from B-pillar and back.

## Advanced driver assistance systems

The BMW i5 M60 xDrive has several standard and optional [advanced driver assistance systems](../../../../technology/driverassistance/)  (ADAS) for better safety and comfort.
### Safety systems



The BMW i5 M60 xDrive has an [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The BMW i5 M60 xDrive has an [**Electronic Stability Control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/electronicstabilitycontrol/)  as a standard system designed to improve a vehicle's stability and handling during sudden maneuvers or slippery road conditions. 

The BMW i5 M60 xDrive has a [**lane-keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has a [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Rear Cross Traffic Alert**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/rearcrosstrafficalert/) is a optional driver assist system that uses sensors to detect approaching vehicles from the side when backing out of a parking space or driveway. 

[**Forward Collision Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/) is a optional driver assist system to help drivers avoid or mitigate frontal collisions. 

The BMW i5 M60 xDrive has an [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/)  as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.

[**Automatic emergency steering**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencysteering/) is a optional  driver assist system designed to help drivers avoid collisions by automatically steering the vehicle in an emergency. 

### Driving Automation

The BMW i5 M60 xDrive offers [driving automation on level 1 or 2](../../../../technology/driverassistance/#level-of-autonomous-driving), depending on the equipment level.

With the Driving Assistant  level 1 system, you get the following driving automation features.
