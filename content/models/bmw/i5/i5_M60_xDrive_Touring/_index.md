## Performance

The BMW i5 M60 xDrive Touring packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 442 kW (601 hp / 593 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 795 Nm (587 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 3.8 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 230 km/h (143 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 84,4 kWh and a net usable capacity of 81,2 kWh, providing an 3,2 kWh buffer (3.8%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 400 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 515 to 456 km (320-283 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels, for instance, can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 15.8 kWh/100 km for the base model and 17.8 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 205 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 56 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 32 minutes with an average charging speed at 106 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 46%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 113 kW, with each charging session taking about 19 minutes and 20 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 22 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 33 minutes. This journey would require four charging stops from 2% to 45%, with a total charging time of 74 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 7 hours and 22 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

BMW i5 M60 xDrive Touring features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Wound-Rotor Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/wrsm/).


### Suspension

The  suspension has adaptive damping on the front and rear axle and air suspension on the rear axle that automatically keeps the car leveled depending on cargo weight. The ground clearance with this suspension is 136 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the BMW i5 M60 xDrive Touring. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as an optional feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes




### Regenerative braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**. You can choose between two stopping modes for one-pedal driving. **Hold mode** brings the vehicle to a complete stop using friction brakes, and **Roll mode** allows the vehicle to roll until it stops naturally.

The maximum regenerative power is 116 kW.

## Exterior

The BMW i5 M60 xDrive Touring, with dimensions of 5060 mm in length, 1900 mm in width, and 1505 mm in height, falls into F-segment cars, also known as luxury or full-size luxury cars, represent the pinnacle of automotive luxury, performance, and technology. They are typically large sedans or limousines and are designed to offer the utmost in comfort, prestige, and advanced features.

You can select from multiple wheel options in different sizes on the BMW i5 M60 xDrive Touring, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 245/50 tires on 19" rims
- 255/45 tires on 20" rims front and 285/40 tires on 20" rims rear
- 255/40 tires on 21" rims front and 285/35 tires on 21" rims rear

More narrow wheels will improve consumption and give a longer range, while wider wheels will provide better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [boot lid](../../../../technology/doors/#boot-lid) for the trunk. Soft close is an optional function for the side doors.

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a large panoramic roof extending over most of the areas from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

Additionally, you can order the car with tinted windows from the B-pillar backward, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
