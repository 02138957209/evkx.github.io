## Performance

The BMW iX2 xDrive30 has a maximum power of 230KW (313hp). The total torque is 494nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 5,6 seconds. The top speed is 180 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 68kWh and a net capacity of 64,7kWh, meaning you have a 3,3kWh buffer for protection. (4,9%). 

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 449 to 417 km (279-259 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 14,4kWh/100km for the basic version and 15,5kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 130kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 61 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 33 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 51% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 85kW. Each charge session would take 23 minutes and 55 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 22kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 12 minutes to drive. This trip will require five charge session(s) charging from 1% to 50%. The total time lost for charging will be 112 minutes.   

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the standard onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 5 hours and 52 minutes. You can also select an optional onboard charger that supports up to 22KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 2 hours and 56 minutes. 

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This makes it easy for charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is standard on the BMW iX2 xDrive30. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. 

### Brakes



[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in several modes. The most efficient is [automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive). In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking to reduce speed. You can also enable [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). You can choose between two stopping modes for one-pedal driving. Hold mode stops the car completely using friction brakes and  roll mode causes the vehicle to roll until it stops by itself. 

## Exterior

You can choose between 12 different paint colors when ordering this model. 
Additionally, you can choose between 3 wheels with sizes from 17 to 19 inches. 

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). 

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof has a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the carâ€™s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

You can order the car with tinted windows from B-pillar and back.
