## Performance

The BMW iX3 delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 210 kW (286 hp / 282 bhp) and a total torque of 400 Nm (295 lb-ft). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 6.8 seconds and reaches a top speed of 180 km/h (112 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 80 kWh and a net usable capacity of 74 kWh, providing an 6 kWh buffer (7.5%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 400 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 461 to 453 km (287-282 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels, for instance, can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 16.1 kWh/100 km for the base model and 16.3 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of  kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 61 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 30 minutes with an average charging speed at 103 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 61%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 102 kW, with each charging session taking about 26 minutes and 4 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 23 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 52 minutes. This journey would require four charging stops from 1% to 54%, with a total charging time of 92 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 6 hours and 43 minutes using a home charging setup.

{{< sitefiguresized thumb="models/bmw/ix3/ix3/charging_1_st.jpg" title="BMW iX3" width="3000" height="2070"  >}}

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

BMW iX3 features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motor used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/).

### Suspension

The Standard suspension has steel springs with a fixed height, but you can adjust damping to fit your driving style or road condition. The ground clearance with this suspension is 179 mm. The Adaptive M Suspension suspension has steel springs with a fixed height, but you can adjust damping to fit your driving style or road condition. The ground clearance with this suspension is 179 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the BMW iX3. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed.

### Brakes



### Regenerative braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**. You can choose between two stopping modes for one-pedal driving. **Hold mode** brings the vehicle to a complete stop using friction brakes, and **Roll mode** allows the vehicle to roll until it stops naturally.

The maximum regenerative power is 134 kW.

## Exterior

The BMW iX3, with dimensions of 4734 mm in length, 1891 mm in width, and 1668 mm in height, falls into the Compact SUVs, also known as C-SUVs, offer a balance between the practicality and maneuverability of smaller vehicles and the space and versatility of larger SUV You can choose between 6 different paint colors when ordering this model.

You can select from multiple wheel options in different sizes on the BMW iX3, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 245/50 tires on 19" rims
- 245/45 tires on 20" rims

More narrow wheels will improve consumption and give a longer range, while wider wheels will provide better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate).

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof has a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

Additionally, you can order the car with tinted windows from the B-pillar backward, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
