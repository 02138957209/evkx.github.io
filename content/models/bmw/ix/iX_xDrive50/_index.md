## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 111kWh and a net capacity of 105,2kWh, meaning you have 5,8kWh reserved as a buffer for protection. (5,2%). The range varies based on the equipment trim. Based on the WLTP standard test, the range varies from 631km to 550km, depending on the equipment. The consumption is between 16,7kWh/100km for the basic version and 19,1kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. 

The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 58 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 31 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 3% to 53% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 135kW. Each charge session would take 23 minutes and 25 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 25kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 24 minutes to drive. This will requires three charge sessions charging from 4% to 50%. The total time lost for charging will be 65 minutes.
