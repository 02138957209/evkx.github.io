## Performance

The BMW iX xDrive40 has a maximum power of 240KW (326hp). The total torque is 630nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 6,1 seconds. The top speed is 200 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 76,6kWh and a net capacity of 71kWh, meaning you have a 5,6kWh buffer for protection. (7,3%). 

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 425 to 372 km (264-231 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 16,7kWh/100km for the basic version and 19,1kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 61 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 34 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 42% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 93kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 43 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 24kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 9 minutes to drive. This trip will require six charge session(s) charging from 1% to 41%. The total time lost for charging will be 110 minutes.   

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 27 minutes. 

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This makes it easy for charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

BMW iX xDrive40 has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motor(s) used are [Wound-Rotor Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/wrsm/). 

The Standard suspension has steel springs with a fixed height, but you can adjust damping to fit your driving style or road condition. The ground clearance with this suspension is 202 mm. 

You can order BMW iX xDrive40 with an alternative Adaptive Air Suspension suspension. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 193 mm, and the max is 223 mm. 

### Steering

Dynamic steering is standard on the BMW iX xDrive40. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is standard. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.  

### Brakes



[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in several modes. The most efficient is [automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive). In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking to reduce speed. You can also enable [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). 

## Exterior

You can choose between 9 different paint colors when ordering this model. 

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). Soft close are an optional function for the regular doors. 

You can choose between two types of roofs on this model. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a large panoramic roof extending from the front to the rear. This glass makes the carâ€™s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass has an electrochromic function that lets you blend the glass to protect against the sun. 

You can order the car with tinted windows from B-pillar and back.
