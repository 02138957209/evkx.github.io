## Performance

The BMW iX1 xDrive30 has a maximum power of 230KW (313hp). The total torque is 494nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 5,6 seconds. The top speed is 180 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 68kWh and a net capacity of 64,7kWh, meaning you have a 3,3kWh buffer for protection. (4,9%). Depending on car options, the [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 440 to 417 km (273-259 mi). Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 14,7kWh/100km for the basic version and 15,5kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 130kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 54 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 28 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 59% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 89kW. Each charge session would take 25 minutes and 26 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 22kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 7 minutes to drive. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 1% to 62%. The total time lost for charging will be 107 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the standard onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 5 hours and 52 minutes. You can also select an optional onboard charger that supports up to 22KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 2 hours and 56 minutes.
