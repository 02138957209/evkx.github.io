## Performance

The BMW iX1 eDrive20 offers modest performance with a maximum power of 150 kW (204 hp / 201 bhp) and a total torque of 250 Nm (184 ft-lb). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 8.6 seconds and has a top speed of 170 km/h (106 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The electric vehicle features a high-capacity battery with a gross capacity of 68 kWh and a net usable capacity of 64,7 kWh, providing an 3,3 kWh buffer (3.6%) for battery protection.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 475 to 430 km (295-267 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels, for instance, can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 13.6 kWh/100 km for the base model and 15.0 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 130 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 61 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 33 minutes with an average charging speed at 83 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 51%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 85 kW, with each charging session taking about 23 minutes and 55 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 22 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 12 minutes. This journey would require five charging stops from 1% to 50%, with a total charging time of 112 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the standard onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 5 hours and 52 minutes. You can also select an optional onboard charger that supports up to 22 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 2 hours and 56 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

BMW iX1 eDrive20 has a front-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the front axle. The motor(s) used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

The Adaptive M Suspension suspension has steel springs with a fixed height, but you can adjust damping to fit your driving style or road condition. The ground clearance with this suspension is 170 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the BMW iX1 eDrive20. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed.

### Brakes



[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in several modes. The most efficient is [automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive). In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking to reduce speed. You can also enable [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). You can choose between two stopping modes for one-pedal driving. Hold mode stops the car completely using friction brakes, and roll mode causes the vehicle to roll until it stops by itself.

## Exterior

You can choose between 12 different paint colors when ordering this model.
Additionally, you can choose between 3 wheels with sizes from 17 to 19 inches.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate).

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof has a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

You can order the car with tinted windows from B-pillar and back.
