We've divided the article into specific sections for easier navigation. Click the links below to jump to different areas or read on for the full article. We also have an overview of the [full specifications](specifications/), an [image gallery](gallery/), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve/), and some [online reviews](reviews/).

## Performance

The BMW i4 eDrive35 delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 210 kW (286 hp / 282 bhp) and a total torque of 400 Nm (295 lb-ft). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 6 seconds and reaches a top speed of 190 km/h (118 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 70,3 kWh and a net usable capacity of 67,1 kWh, providing an 3,2 kWh buffer (4.6%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 399 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 490 to 406 km (305-252 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels, for instance, can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 13.7 kWh/100 km for the base model and 16.5 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 180 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 47 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 24 minutes with an average charging speed at 116 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 3% to 51%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 112 kW, with each charging session taking about 17 minutes and 16 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 18 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 22 minutes. This journey would require four charging stops from 3% to 46%, with a total charging time of 62 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 6 hours and 6 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

BMW i4 eDrive35 has a rear-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the rear axle. The motor used are [Wound-Rotor Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/wrsm/).

### Suspension

The Standard suspension has air suspension on the rear axle that automaticly keep the car leveled depending on cargo weight. The ground clearance with this suspension is 125 mm. The  suspension has adaptive damping on the front and rear axle and air suspension on the rear axle that automatically keeps the car leveled depending on cargo weight. The ground clearance with this suspension is 125 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the BMW i4 eDrive35. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as a standard feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes).

### Regenerative braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**. You can choose between two stopping modes for one-pedal driving. **Hold mode** brings the vehicle to a complete stop using friction brakes, and **Roll mode** allows the vehicle to roll until it stops naturally.

The maximum regenerative power is 116 kW.

## Exterior

The BMW i4 eDrive35, with dimensions of 4783 mm in length, 1852 mm in width, and 1448 mm in height, falls into D-segment cars, also known as mid-size or family cars, offer more space, comfort, and features than smaller segments, making them suitable for a variety of drivers. The BMW i4 eDrive35 is available in a total of 11 paint colors, including several striking metallic options.

You can select from multiple wheel options in different sizes on the BMW i4 eDrive35, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 245/45 tires on 18" rims front and 255/45 tires on 18" rims rear
- 245/40 tires on 19" rims front and 255/40 tires on 19" rims rear
- 245/35 tires on 20" rims front and 255/35 tires on 20" rims rear

More narrow wheels will improve consumption and give a longer range, while wider wheels will provide better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). Soft close is an optional function for the side doors.

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a sunroof. The glass extends over only the front row, and occupants can open it. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

Additionally, you can order the car with tinted windows from the B-pillar backward, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
