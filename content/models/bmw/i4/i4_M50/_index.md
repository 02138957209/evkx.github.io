## Performance

The BMW i4 M50 has a maximum power of 400KW (544hp). The total torque is 795nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 3,9 seconds. The top speed is 225 kph. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 83,9kWh and a net capacity of 80,7kWh, meaning you have a 3,2kWh buffer for protection. (3,8%).  The WLTP range varies from 631 to 550 km (392-342 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an option that increases consumption and reduces range.   The consumption is between 12,8kWh/100km for the basic version and 14,7kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. 

The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 44 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 24 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 3% to 56% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 127kW. Each charge session would take 20 minutes and 15 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 21kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 21 minutes to drive. This will requires three charge sessions charging from 3% to 57%. The total time lost for charging will be 62 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 20 minutes.
