## Performance

The BMW i4 eDrive40 has a maximum power of 250KW (340hp). The total torque is 430nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 5,7 seconds. The top speed is 190 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 83,9kWh and a net capacity of 80,7kWh, meaning you have a 3,2kWh buffer for protection. (3,8%). The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 590 to 493 km (367-306 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 13,7kWh/100km for the basic version and 16,4kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 56 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 29 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 3% to 50% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 118kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 20 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 18kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 11 minutes to drive. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 3% to 45%. The total time lost for charging will be 52 minutes.   

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 20 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This makes it easy for charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
