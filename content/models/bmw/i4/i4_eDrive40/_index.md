## Performance

The BMW i4 eDrive40 has a maximum power of 250KW (340hp). The total torque is 430nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 5,7 seconds. The top speed is 190 kph. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 83,9kWh and a net capacity of 80,7kWh, meaning you have a 3,2kWh buffer for protection. (3,8%). Depending on car options, the [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 590 to 493 km (367-306 mi). Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 13,7kWh/100km for the basic version and 16,4kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. 

The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 56 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 29 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 3% to 50% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 118kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 20 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 18kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 11 minutes to drive. This will requires three charge sessions charging from 3% to 45%. The total time lost for charging will be 52 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 20 minutes.
