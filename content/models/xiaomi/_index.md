The SU7 is priced competitively, starting at around $29,900, which is less than Tesla's Model 3. Xiaomi's EV strategy involves leveraging China's rapidly expanding EV supply chain and integrating their own developed technologies such as the E-Motor, CTB Integrated Battery, Xiaomi Die-Casting, Xiaomi Pilot Autonomous Driving, and Smart Cabinh. Xiaomi has made a significant investment in R&D, with over CNY 10 billion RMB invested and a global team of more than 3,400 engineers and 1,000 technical experts. The company aims to redefine connectivity by merging personal devices, smart home products, and cars into a seamless ecosystem.The entry of Xiaomi into the EV market is seen as a bold move, especially after the discontinuation of purchasing subsidies in China in late 2022.
