## Performance

The Xiaomi SU7 offers modest performance with a maximum power of 220 kW (299 hp / 295 bhp) and a total torque of 400 Nm (295 ft-lb). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.28 seconds and has a top speed of 210 km/h (131 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 73,6kWh and a net capacity of 73kWh, meaning you have a 0,6kWh buffer for protection. (0.8%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [LFP technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp) This has some benefits and disadvantages from the typical NCA/NCM batteries.

The [CLTC range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/cltc/) is 700 km ( miles). The consumption is 10.4kWh/100km for the CLTC standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 45 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 25 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 3% to 72%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 108kW. Each charge session would take 28 minutes and 1 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 16kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 9 minutes. This trip will require two charge session(s) charging from 3% to 63%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 49 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 38 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
