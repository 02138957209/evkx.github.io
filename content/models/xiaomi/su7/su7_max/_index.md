## Performance

The Xiaomi SU7 Max has a maximum power of 495 KW (673 hp/664 bhp) and a total torque of 838 nm (618 ft-lb). It can sprint from 0 to 100km/h (0 to 62mph) in 2.78 seconds and has a top speed of 265 km/h (164.7 mph).

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 101kWh and a net capacity of 99kWh, meaning you have a 2kWh buffer for protection. (2.0%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

The [CLTC range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/cltc/) is 800 km ( miles). The consumption is 12.4kWh/100km for the CLTC standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 40 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 19 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 3% to 74%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 182kW. Each charge session would take 23 minutes and 12 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 17kWh/100km, 1000km will take 8 hours and 43 minutes. This trip will require one charge session(s) charging from 3% to 75%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 24 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 9 hours and 0 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Xiaomi SU7 Max has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/) at the front axle and [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/) at the rear axle.

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 160 mm, and the maximum is 140 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Xiaomi SU7 Max. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes).

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available through [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal). [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. The system stops the car completely using friction brakes.

## Exterior

You can choose between 9 different paint colors when ordering this model.
