## Performance

The Xiaomi SU7 Max has a maximum power of 495 KW (673 hp/664 bhp). The total torque is 838 nm (618 ft-lb). It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 2.78 seconds. The top speed is 265 km/h.

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 101kWh and a net capacity of 99kWh, meaning you have a 2kWh buffer for protection. (2.0%).

The [CLTC range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/cltc/) is 800 km ( miles). The consumption is 12.4kWh/100km for the CLTC standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 60 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 30 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 3% to 55%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 133kW. Each charge session would take 23 minutes and 9 seconds.
