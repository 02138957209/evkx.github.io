## Performance

The Xiaomi SU7 Max packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 495 kW (673 hp / 664 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 838 Nm (618 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 2.78 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 265 km/h (165 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 101 kWh and a net usable capacity of 99 kWh, providing an 2 kWh buffer (2.0%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 871 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

The vehicle's range, according to the [CLTC](../../../../guides/understandingrange/cltc/) (China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle) standard, is 800 km ( miles). he energy consumption is 12.4 kWh/100 km based on the CLTC standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of  kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 40 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 19 minutes with an average charging speed at 223 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 3% to 74%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 182 kW, with each charging session taking about 23 minutes and 12 seconds.. This exceptionally fast charging capability makes the Xiaomi SU7 Max one of the most efficient and convenient EVs for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 17 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 8 hours and 43 minutes. This journey would require one charging stops from 3% to 75%, with a total charging time of 24 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 9 hours and 0 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
