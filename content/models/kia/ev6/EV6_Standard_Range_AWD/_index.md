## Performance

The Kia EV6 Standard Range AWD has a maximum power of 173KW (235hp). The total torque is 605nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 6,2 seconds. The top speed is 185 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 58kWh and a net capacity of 54kWh, meaning you have a 4kWh buffer for protection. (6,9%).  The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 371 km (231 mi).   The consumption is 14,6kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 233kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 28 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 12 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 82% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 140kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 42 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 21kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 27 minutes to drive. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 1% to 74%. The total time lost for charging will be 68 minutes.   

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 4 hours and 54 minutes.

The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
