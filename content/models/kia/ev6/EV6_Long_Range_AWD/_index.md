## Performance

The Kia EV6 Long Range AWD has a maximum power of 239KW (325hp). The total torque is 605nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 5,2 seconds. The top speed is 185 kph. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 77,4kWh and a net capacity of 74kWh, meaning you have a 3,4kWh buffer for protection. (4,4%). Depending on car options, the [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 528 to 484 km (328-301 mi). Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 14,0kWh/100km for the basic version and 15,3kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 233kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 38 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 16 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 76% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 152kW. Each charge session would take 22 minutes and 59 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 20kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 11 minutes to drive. This will requires two charge sessions charging from 0% to 86%. The total time lost for charging will be 51 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 43 minutes.
