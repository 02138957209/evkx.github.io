## Performance

The Kia EV6 Long Range AWD offers modest performance with a maximum power of 239 kW (325 hp / 321 bhp) and a total torque of 605 Nm (446 ft-lb). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.2 seconds and has a top speed of185 km/h (115 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 77,4kWh and a net capacity of 74kWh, meaning you have a 3,4kWh buffer for protection. (4.4%).

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) varies from 506 to 484 km (315-301 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range. The consumption is between 14.6kWh/100km for the basic version and 15.3kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 233kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 38 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 16 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 76%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 152kW. Each charge session would take 22 minutes and 59 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 21kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 15 minutes. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 1% to 63%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 56 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 43 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
