## Performance

The Kia EV6 Long Range AWD has a maximum power of 239KW (325hp). The total torque is 605nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 5,2 seconds. The top speed is 185 kph. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 77,4kWh and a net capacity of 74kWh, meaning you have a 3,4kWh buffer for protection. (4,4%). Depending on car options, the [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 528 to 504 km (328-313 mi). Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 14,0kWh/100km for the basic version and 14,7kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 239kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 41 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 20 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 58% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 143kW. Each charge session would take 18 minutes and 40 seconds.
