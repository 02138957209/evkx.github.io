## Performance

The Kia Niro EV offers modest performance with a maximum power of 150 kW (204 hp / 201 bhp) and a total torque of 255 Nm (188 ft-lb). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 7.8 seconds and has a top speed of 167 km/h (104 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The electric vehicle features a high-capacity battery with a gross capacity of 68 kWh and a net usable capacity of 64,8 kWh, providing an 3,2 kWh buffer (3.6%) for battery protection.

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) is 463 km (288 mi). The consumption is 14.0kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 233 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 93 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 44 minutes with an average charging speed at 61 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 4% to 56%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 60 kW, with each charging session taking about 33 minutes and 30 seconds..

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 20kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 35 minutes. This trip will require five charge session(s) charging from 4% to 46%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 136 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 5 hours and 53 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [front](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to park with the front in. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
