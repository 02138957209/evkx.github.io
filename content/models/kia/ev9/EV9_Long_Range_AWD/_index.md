## Performance

The Kia EV9 Long Range AWD has a maximum power of 283 KW (385 hp/380 bhp). The total torque is 700 nm (517 ft-lb). It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 5,3 seconds. The top speed is 200 km/h.

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 99,8kWh and a net capacity of 98kWh, meaning you have a 1,8kWh buffer for protection. (1,8%).

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) varies from 497 to 484 km (309-301 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range. The consumption is between 19.7kWh/100km for the basic version and 20.2kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 233kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 50 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 21 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 71%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 161kW. Each charge session would take 26 minutes and 38 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 25kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 17 minutes. This trip will require two charge session(s) charging from 1% to 79%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 57 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 8 hours and 54 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

Both glass panels have an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

You can order the car with tinted windows from B-pillar and back.
