## Performance

With overboost, the Porsche Macan reaches a maximum power of 265 kW (360 hp / 355 bhp). Without overboost, it delivers 250 kW (340 hp / 335 bhp). The maximum torque is 563 Nm (415 lb-ft). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.7 seconds and reaches a top speed of 220 km/h (137 mph), demonstrating its solid performance.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 100 kWh and a net usable capacity of 94,9 kWh, providing an 5,1 kWh buffer (5.1%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 662 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 641 to 516 km (398-321 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels, for instance, can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 14.8 kWh/100 km for the base model and 18.4 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 270 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 59 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 20 minutes with an average charging speed at 196 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 64%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 171 kW, with each charging session taking about 21 minutes and 56 seconds.. This efficient charging capability makes the Porsche Macan a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 21.5 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 2 minutes. This journey would require two charging stops from 1% to 65%, with a total charging time of 43 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 8 hours and 37 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications. Additionally, a second port on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side) offers greater flexibility for AC charging. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**J1772**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#j1772) for North America and for Europe, [**TYPE2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#type-2). For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

Porsche Macan has a rear-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the rear axle. The motors used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).


### Suspension

The front suspension employs a [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone) design, while the rear uses a [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink) setup. The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The Standard suspension has steel springs with a fixed height but an optional damping adjustment. The ground clearance with this suspension is 184 mm. The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 185 mm, and the maximum is 224 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Porsche Macan. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as an optional feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 410mm, and the rear discs are 365mm.


### Regenerative braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**.

The maximum regenerative power is 275 kW.

## Exterior

The Porsche Macan, with dimensions of 4784 mm in length, 1938 mm in width, and 1622 mm in height, falls into the Compact SUVs, also known as C-SUVs, offer a balance between the practicality and maneuverability of smaller vehicles and the space and versatility of larger SUV The Porsche Macan is available in a total of 13 paint colors, including both solid and metallic options.

The optional SportDesign package HighGloss black contains a specially designed upper part front apron, specially designed side skirts in Black with inlays painted in Black (high-gloss), specially designed rear diffusor in Black with side fins painted in Black (high-gloss),front licence plate carrier painted in exterior color. 



You can select from multiple wheel options in different sizes on the Porsche Macan, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 235/55 tires on 20" rims front and 285/45 tires on 20" rims rear
- 245/45 tires on 21" rims front and 295/40 tires on 21" rims rear
- 255/40 tires on 22" rims front and 295/35 tires on 22" rims rear

More narrow wheels will improve consumption and give a longer range, while wider wheels will provide better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate).

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

Additionally, you can order the car with tinted windows from the B-pillar backward, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
