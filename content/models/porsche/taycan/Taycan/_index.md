## Performance

With overboost, the Porsche Taycan has a maximum power of 300KW (408hp). Without overboost, it is 240KW (326hp). The torque is 345nm with overboost and  without overboost. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 5,4 seconds. The top speed is 230 kph. 

With the optional Performance Battery Plus battery, you get other performance numbers. With overboost, the Porsche Taycan has a maximum power of 350KW (476hp). Without overboost, it is 280KW (381hp). The torque is 357nm with overboost and  without overboost. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 5,4 seconds. The top speed is 230 kph. 

## Battery, range, and charging

Porsche Taycan has two battery options with different specifications. Below you see how this affects range and charging. 
### Performance Battery

The battery has a gross capacity of 79,2kWh and a net capacity of 71kWh, meaning you have a 8,2kWh buffer for protection. (10,4%).  The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 431 to 354 km (268-220 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an option that increases consumption and reduces range.   The consumption is between 16,5kWh/100km for the basic version and 20,1kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 225kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 45 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 19 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 0% to 67% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 136kW. Each charge session would take 21 minutes and 2 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 22kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 26 minutes to drive. This will requires three charge sessions charging from 0% to 70%. The total time lost for charging will be 66 minutes.   
### Performance Battery Plus

The battery has a gross capacity of 93,4kWh and a net capacity of 83,7kWh, meaning you have a 9,7kWh buffer for protection. (10,4%).  The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 484 to 407 km (301-253 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an option that increases consumption and reduces range.   The consumption is between 16,5kWh/100km for the basic version and 20,1kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 270kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 50 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 18 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 3% to 65% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 165kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 53 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 22kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 10 minutes to drive. This will requires three charge sessions charging from 3% to 58%. The total time lost for charging will be 51 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the standard onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 27 minutes. You can also select an optional onboard charger that supports up to 22KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 3 hours and 13 minutes. 

## Drivetrain

Porsche Taycan has a rear-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the rear axle. 

The Standard suspension has steel springs with a fixed height, but you can adjust damping to fit your driving style or road condition. The ground clearance with this suspension is 127 mm. 

You can order Porsche Taycan with an alternative Adaptive Air Suspension suspension. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. Minimum ground clearance is 103 mm and max 127 mm. 

### Steering

Dynamic steering is standard on Porsche Taycan. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is optional. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

The third option brakes uses ceramic discs. The front discs are 420mm, and the rear discs are 410mm.
