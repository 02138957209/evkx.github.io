## Performance

With overboost, the Porsche Taycan Turbo S (GEN1) reaches a maximum power of 560 kW (761 hp / 751 bhp). Without overboost, it provides a strong 460 kW (625 hp / 617 bhp). The maxium torque is at 850 Nm (627 lb-ft). This powerhouse can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 2.8 seconds and reaches a top speed of 260 km/h (162 mph), showcasing its impressive performance.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 93,4 kWh and a net usable capacity of 83,7 kWh, providing an 9,7 kWh buffer (10.4%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 725 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 507 to 435 km (315-270 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels, for instance, can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 16.5 kWh/100 km for the base model and 19.2 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 270 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 50 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 18 minutes with an average charging speed at 196 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 3% to 65%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 165 kW, with each charging session taking about 19 minutes and 53 seconds.. This efficient charging capability makes the Porsche Taycan Turbo S (GEN1) a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 22 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 10 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 3% to 58%, with a total charging time of 51 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 7 hours and 36 minutes using a home charging setup. For faster charging, you can opt for an optional onboard charger that supports up to 22 kW. With this upgrade, you can achieve a full charge from 0 to 100% in just about 3 hours and 48 minutes at home.

### Charge port

The charge port is conveniently located on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side), facilitating easy access at charging stations where you park parallel to the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications. Additionally, a second port on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side) offers greater flexibility for AC charging. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**J1772**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#j1772) for North America and for Europe, [**TYPE2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#type-2). For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
