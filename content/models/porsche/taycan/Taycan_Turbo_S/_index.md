## Performance

With overboost, the Porsche Taycan Turbo S has a maximum power of 560KW (761hp). Without overboost, it is 460KW (625hp). The torque is 850nm with overboost and  without overboost. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 2,8 seconds. The top speed is 260 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 93,4kWh and a net capacity of 83,7kWh, meaning you have a 9,7kWh buffer for protection. (10,4%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc) 

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 507 to 435 km (315-270 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 16,5kWh/100km for the basic version and 19,2kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 270kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 50 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 18 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 3% to 65% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 165kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 53 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 22kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 10 minutes to drive. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 3% to 58%. The total time lost for charging will be 51 minutes.   

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the standard onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 36 minutes. You can also select an optional onboard charger that supports up to 22KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 3 hours and 48 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger.  The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets. A second port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This extra port gives you more parking options for AC charging. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**J1772**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#j1772) for North America and for Europe, [**TYPE2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#type-2). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Porsche Taycan Turbo S has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motor(s) used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/). 



You can order Porsche Taycan Turbo S with an alternative Adaptive Air Suspension suspension. The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink).
