## Performance

With overboost, the Porsche Taycan Turbo S Sport Turismo delivers an astonishing maximum power of 700 kW (952 hp / 939 bhp). Even without overboost, it boasts a formidable 620 kW (843 hp / 831 bhp). The maximum torque reaches an incredible 1110 Nm (819 ft-lb). This powerhouse can rocket from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in a mere 2.4 seconds and achieves a top speed of 260 km/h (162 mph), underscoring its breathtaking performance.

## Battery, range, and charging

The electric vehicle features a high-capacity battery with a gross capacity of 105 kWh and a net usable capacity of 97 kWh, providing an 8 kWh buffer (3.6%) for battery protection. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 604 to 529 km (375-329 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels, for instance, can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 16.1 kWh/100 km for the base model and 18.3 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 320 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 46 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 15 minutes with an average charging speed at 265 kW. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 65%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 212kW. Each charge session would take 18 minutes and 32 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 22kWh/100km, 1000km will take 8 hours and 55 minutes. This trip will require two charge session(s) charging from 1% to 65%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 35 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the standard onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 8 hours and 49 minutes. You can also select an optional onboard charger that supports up to 22 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 4 hours and 24 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you park side into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets. A second port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This extra port gives you more parking options for AC charging. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**J1772**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#j1772) for North America and for Europe, [**TYPE2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#type-2). See full specifications for all markets.
