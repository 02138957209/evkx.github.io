## Performance

With overboost, the Porsche Taycan Turbo S Cross Turismo delivers an astonishing maximum power of 700 kW (952 hp / 939 bhp). Even without overboost, it boasts a formidable 570 kW (775 hp / 764 bhp). The maximum torque reaches an incredible 1110 Nm (819 lb-ft). This powerhouse can rocket from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in a mere 2.5 seconds and achieves a top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph), underscoring its breathtaking performance.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 105 kWh and a net usable capacity of 97 kWh, providing an 8 kWh buffer (7.6%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 725 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 596 to 516 km (370-321 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels, for instance, can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 16.3 kWh/100 km for the base model and 18.8 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 320 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 46 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 15 minutes with an average charging speed at 265 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 65%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 212 kW, with each charging session taking about 18 minutes and 32 seconds.. This exceptionally fast charging capability makes the Porsche Taycan Turbo S Cross Turismo one of the most efficient and convenient EVs for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 22 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 8 hours and 55 minutes. This journey would require two charging stops from 1% to 65%, with a total charging time of 35 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 8 hours and 49 minutes using a home charging setup. For faster charging, you can opt for an optional onboard charger that supports up to 22 kW. With this upgrade, you can achieve a full charge from 0 to 100% in just about 4 hours and 24 minutes at home.

### Charge port

The charge port is conveniently located on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side), facilitating easy access at charging stations where you park parallel to the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications. Additionally, a second port on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side) offers greater flexibility for AC charging. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**J1772**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#j1772) for North America and for Europe, [**TYPE2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#type-2). For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Porsche Taycan Turbo S Cross Turismo. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as a standard feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [ceramic discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#ceramic-brakes). The front discs are 420mm, and the rear discs are 410mm.

### Regenerative braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**.

The maximum regenerative power is 275 kW.
