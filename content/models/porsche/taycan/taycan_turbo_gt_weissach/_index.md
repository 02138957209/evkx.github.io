## Performance

With overboost, the Porsche Taycan Turbo GT Weissach delivers an astonishing maximum power of 815 kW (1108 hp / 1093 bhp). Even without overboost, it boasts a formidable 815 kW (1108 hp / 1093 bhp). The maximum torque reaches an incredible 1340 Nm (989 lb-ft). This powerhouse can rocket from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in a mere 2.2 seconds and achieves a top speed of 300 km/h (186 mph), underscoring its breathtaking performance.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 105 kWh and a net usable capacity of 97 kWh, providing an 8 kWh buffer (7.6%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 725 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 558 to 555 km (347-345 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels, for instance, can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 17.4 kWh/100 km for the base model and 17.5 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 320 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 46 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 15 minutes with an average charging speed at 265 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 65%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 212 kW, with each charging session taking about 18 minutes and 32 seconds.. This exceptionally fast charging capability makes the Porsche Taycan Turbo GT Weissach one of the most efficient and convenient EVs for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 22 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 8 hours and 55 minutes. This journey would require two charging stops from 1% to 65%, with a total charging time of 35 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 8 hours and 49 minutes using a home charging setup. For faster charging, you can opt for an optional onboard charger that supports up to 22 kW. With this upgrade, you can achieve a full charge from 0 to 100% in just about 4 hours and 24 minutes at home.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**J1772**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#j1772) for North America and for Europe, [**TYPE2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#type-2). For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
