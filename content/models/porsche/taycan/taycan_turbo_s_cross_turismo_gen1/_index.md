## Performance

With overboost, the Porsche Taycan Turbo S Cross Turismo (GEN1) reaches a maximum power of 560 kW (761 hp / 751 bhp). Without overboost, it provides a strong 460 kW (625 hp / 617 bhp). The maxium torque is at 850 Nm (627 lb-ft). This powerhouse can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 2.8 seconds and reaches a top speed of 260 km/h (162 mph), showcasing its impressive performance.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 93,4 kWh and a net usable capacity of 83,7 kWh, providing an 9,7 kWh buffer (10.4%) for battery protection. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 419 to 388 km (260-241 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels, for instance, can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 20.0 kWh/100 km for the base model and 21.6 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 270 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 50 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 18 minutes with an average charging speed at 196 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 3% to 65%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 165 kW, with each charging session taking about 19 minutes and 53 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 22 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 10 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 3% to 58%, with a total charging time of 51 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the standard onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 36 minutes. You can also select an optional onboard charger that supports up to 22 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 3 hours and 48 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you park side into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets. A second port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This extra port gives you more parking options for AC charging. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**J1772**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#j1772) for North America and for Europe, [**TYPE2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#type-2). See full specifications for all markets.
