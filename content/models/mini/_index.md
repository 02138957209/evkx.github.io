Mini's EV strategy is to go all-electric by 2030, according to a report by Bloomberg. The brand will launch its last combustion-engine variant in 2025, and around half of all Mini sales should be electric by 2027. Mini will produce electric cars in the UK, China, and Germany, in partnership with Great Wall Motors. Mini plans to introduce a compact electric SUV, the Aceman, and an electric Cabriolet in the next few years. Mini's vision is to offer a unique combination of performance, connectivity, and sustainability to its customers, and to appeal to urban areas where electric cars are in high demand .
