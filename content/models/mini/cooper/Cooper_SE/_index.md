## Performance

The Mini Cooper SE offers modest performance with a maximum power of 160 kW (218 hp / 215 bhp) and a total torque of 330 Nm (244 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 6.7 seconds and has a top speed of 170 km/h (106 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 54,2 kWh and a net usable capacity of 49 kWh, providing an 5,2 kWh buffer (9.6%) for battery protection.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 402 to 377 km (250-234 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels, for instance, can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 12.2 kWh/100 km for the base model and 13.0 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 95 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 61 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 31 minutes with an average charging speed at 66 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 7% to 58%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 62 kW, with each charging session taking about 24 minutes and 12 seconds..

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 4 hours and 27 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Exterior

The Mini Cooper SE, with dimensions of 3900 mm in length, 1750 mm in width, and 1450 mm in height, falls into the B-segment car, often referred to as a supermini, is a small car typically suitable for urban driving, offering a good balance of efficiency, size, and cost.

- 215/55 tires on 16" rims
- 205/50 tires on 17" rims
- 225/40 tires on 18" rims

More narrow wheels will improve consumption and give a longer range, while wider wheels will provide better traction and handling.



There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with large panoramic roof extending from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

Additionally, you can order the car with tinted windows from the B-pillar backward, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
