We also have an overview of the [full specifications](specifications/), an [image gallery](gallery/), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve/), and some [online reviews](reviews/).

## Performance

The Mini Cooper SE has a maximum power of 160 KW (218 hp/215 bhp) and a total torque of 330 nm (244 ft-lb). It can sprint from 0 to 100km/h (0 to 62mph) in  seconds

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 54,2kWh and a net capacity of 49kWh, meaning you have a 5,2kWh buffer for protection. (9.6%).

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) varies from 402 to 377 km (250-234 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range. The consumption is between 12.2kWh/100km for the basic version and 13.0kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 95kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 61 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 31 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 7% to 58%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 62kW. Each charge session would take 24 minutes and 12 seconds.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 4 hours and 27 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
