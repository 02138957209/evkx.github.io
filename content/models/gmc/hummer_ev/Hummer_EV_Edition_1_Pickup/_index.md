## Performance

The GMC Hummer EV Edition 1 Pickup has a maximum power of 746 KW (1014 hp/1000 bhp). The total torque is 1150 nm (849 ft-lb). It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 3,5 seconds. The top speed is 170 km/h.

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 220kWh and a net capacity of 213kWh, meaning you have a 7kWh buffer for protection. (3,2%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc) 

 The [EPA range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) is 329 miles (529 km).   The consumption is 1.5mi/kWh for the EPA standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 350kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 139 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 48 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 52%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 245kW. Each charge session would take 27 minutes and 39 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 43kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 13 minutes. This trip will require two charge session(s) charging from 1% to 52%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 53 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 19 hours and 21 minutes. 

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
