## Performance

The GMC Hummer EV Edition 1 Pickup delivers a jaw-dropping maximum power of 746 KW (1014 hp/1000 bhp) and a massive total torque of 1150 Nm (849 lb-ft). This powerhouse can rocket from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 3.5 seconds, showcasing its astonishing acceleration. Additionally, it achieves a top speed of 170 km/h (106 mph), making it a true marvel of engineering and performance.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 220 kWh and a net usable capacity of 213 kWh, providing an 7 kWh buffer (3.2%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 650 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

According to the [EPA](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) (Environmental Protection Agency) standard, the vehicle has an range of 329 miles (529 km) with an energy consumption rate of 1.5 miles per kWh. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 350 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 139 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 48 minutes with an average charging speed at 186 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 52%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 245 kW, with each charging session taking about 27 minutes and 39 seconds.. This efficient charging capability makes the GMC Hummer EV Edition 1 Pickup a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 43 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 13 minutes. This journey would require two charging stops from 1% to 52%, with a total charging time of 53 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 19 hours and 21 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
