## Performance

The HiPhi Z 5 Seater has a maximum power of 494 KW (672 hp/663 bhp). The total torque is 820 nm (605 ft-lb). It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 3.8 seconds.

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 120kWh and a net capacity of 113kWh, meaning you have a 7kWh buffer for protection. (5.8%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) is 555 km (345 mi). The consumption is 20.4kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 92 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 47 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 4% to 48%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 103kW. Each charge session would take 29 minutes and 59 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 28kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 58 minutes. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 5% to 42%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 98 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 10 hours and 16 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. This model uses [**GBT**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#gbt) for China and Europe, meaning you must use a CCS2>GBT adapter in Europe. See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

HiPhi Z 5 Seater has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motor(s) used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 150 mm, and the maximum is 200 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the HiPhi Z 5 Seater. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as a standard feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes).



## Exterior

You can choose between 6 different paint colors when ordering this model.

The car has two [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) in front, [suicide doors](../../../../technology/doors/) on the second row, and a [bootlid](../../../../technology/doors/#bootlid) in the rear. Powered doors are a standard function for the side doors.

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof has a large panoramic roof extending from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car's interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted.

The HiPhi Z 5 Seater has an [**Electronic Stability Control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/electronicstabilitycontrol/)  as a standard system designed to improve a vehicle's stability and handling during sudden maneuvers or slippery road conditions.

The HiPhi Z 5 Seater has a [**lane-keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has a [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Front Cross Traffic Assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/frontcrosstrafficassist/) is a standard driver assist system that helps drivers detect oncoming traffic when crossing an intersection or turning left or right from a stopped position.

[**Forward Collision Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/) is a standard driver assist system to help drivers avoid or mitigate frontal collisions.

The HiPhi Z 5 Seater has [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/) as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.
