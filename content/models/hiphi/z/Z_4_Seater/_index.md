We have separated our HiPhi Z 4 Seater article into sections. If you want to wait to read the full article, click the links below to the different areas. We also have an overview of the [full specifications](specifications), an [image gallery](gallery), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve), and some [online reviews](reviews). Our sections:

## Performance

The HiPhi Z 4 Seater has a maximum power of 494KW (672hp). The total torque is 820nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 3,8 seconds. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 125kWh and a net capacity of 120kWh, meaning you have a 5kWh buffer for protection. (4,0%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc) 

 The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 555 km (345 mi).   The consumption is 21,6kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 98 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 50 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 4% to 47% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 104kW. Each charge session would take 30 minutes and 46 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 28kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 53 minutes to drive. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 4% to 49%. The total time lost for charging will be 94 minutes.   

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 10 hours and 54 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear corner](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-corner). This makes it easy for charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

HiPhi Z 4 Seater has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motor(s) used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/). 

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 150 mm, and the max is 200 mm. 

### Steering

Dynamic steering is standard on the HiPhi Z 4 Seater. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is standard. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.  

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). 



## Exterior

You can choose between 6 different paint colors when ordering this model. 

The car has two [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) in front, [suicide doors](../../../../technology/doors/) on the second row, and a [bootlid](../../../../technology/doors/#bootlid) in the rear. Powered doors are an standard function for the side doors. 

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof has a large panoramic roof extending from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car's interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted.
