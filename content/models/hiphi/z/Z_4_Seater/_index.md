We've divided the article into specific sections for easier navigation. Click the links below to jump to different areas or read on for the full article. We also have an overview of the [full specifications](specifications/), an [image gallery](gallery/), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve/), and some [online reviews](reviews/).

## Performance

The HiPhi Z 4 Seater packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 494 kW (672 hp / 663 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 820 Nm (605 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 3.8 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 120 kWh and a net usable capacity of 113 kWh, providing an 7 kWh buffer (5.8%) for battery protection. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 555 km (345 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 20.4 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of  kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 92 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 47 minutes with an average charging speed at 100 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 4% to 48%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 103 kW, with each charging session taking about 29 minutes and 59 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 28 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 58 minutes. This journey would require four charging stops from 5% to 42%, with a total charging time of 98 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 10 hours and 16 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. This model uses [**GBT**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#gbt) for China and Europe, meaning you must use a CCS2>GBT adapter in Europe. See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

HiPhi Z 4 Seater has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motor(s) used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 150 mm, and the maximum is 200 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the HiPhi Z 4 Seater. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as a standard feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes).



## Exterior

You can choose between 6 different paint colors when ordering this model.

The car has two [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) in front, [suicide doors](../../../../technology/doors/) on the second row, and a [bootlid](../../../../technology/doors/#bootlid) in the rear. Powered doors are a standard function for the side doors.

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof has a large panoramic roof extending from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car's interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted.

## Advanced driver assistance systems

The HiPhi Z 4 Seater has several standard and optional [advanced driver assistance systems](../../../../technology/driverassistance/)  (ADAS) for better safety and comfort.
### Safety systems



The HiPhi Z 4 Seater has an [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The HiPhi Z 4 Seater has an [**Electronic Stability Control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/electronicstabilitycontrol/)  as a standard system designed to improve a vehicle's stability and handling during sudden maneuvers or slippery road conditions.

The HiPhi Z 4 Seater has a [**lane-keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has a [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Front Cross Traffic Assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/frontcrosstrafficassist/) is a standard driver assist system that helps drivers detect oncoming traffic when crossing an intersection or turning left or right from a stopped position.

[**Forward Collision Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/) is a standard driver assist system to help drivers avoid or mitigate frontal collisions.

The HiPhi Z 4 Seater has [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/) as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.

[**Blind-spot monitoring**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/blindspotmonitoring/) is a standard driver-assist system. This side assist system helps to detect traffic in blind spots.

[**Exit Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/exitwarning/) is a standard driver-assist system designed to warn occupants against opening doors if there is a risk of hitting something.

### Driving Automation



With the   level 2 system, you get the following driving automation features.
- [**Adaptive Cruise control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/adaptivecruisecontrol/)
- [**Lane Centering Assist (LCA) /AutoSteer**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/autosteer/): keeps the car in your lane and slows down if needed in traffic. The system limits how long you can drive without touching the steering wheel.
- [**Automatic parking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticparking/).
