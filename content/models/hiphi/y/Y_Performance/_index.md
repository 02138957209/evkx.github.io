## Performance

The HiPhi Y Performance has a maximum power of 371KW (504hp). The total torque is 620nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 4,7 seconds. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 115kWh and a net capacity of 109kWh, meaning you have a 6kWh buffer for protection. (5,2%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)  The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 620 km (385 mi).   The consumption is 17,6kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 91 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 47 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 4% to 49% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 98kW. Each charge session would take 30 minutes and 56 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 28kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 6 minutes to drive. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 3% to 56%. The total time lost for charging will be 106 minutes.   

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 9 hours and 54 minutes. 

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This makes it easy for charge stations where you need to back up in to the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

HiPhi Y Performance has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motor(s) used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/). 

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has steel springs with a fixed height, but you can adjust damping to fit your driving style or road condition. The ground clearance with this suspension is 200 mm. 

### Steering

Dynamic steering is standard on the HiPhi Y Performance. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is standard. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.  

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). 



## Exterior

You can choose between 5 different paint colors when ordering this model. 

The car has two [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) in front, a unique combination of regular doors with a gullwing roof on the second row, and a  [hatchback-style liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#hatcback-style-liftgate) in the rear. Powered doors are an standard function for the side doors. 

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof has a panoramic glass over first row in addition to the roof part of the gullving doors have glass. This glass makes the carâ€™s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted.
