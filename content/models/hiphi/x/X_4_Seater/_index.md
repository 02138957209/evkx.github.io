## Performance

The HiPhi X 4 Seater packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 433 kW (589 hp / 581 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 820 Nm (605 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 3.9 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 101 kWh and a net usable capacity of 97 kWh, providing an 4 kWh buffer (4.0%) for battery protection. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 460 km (286 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 21.1 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of  kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 79 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 41 minutes with an average charging speed at 100 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 4% to 51%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 100 kW, with each charging session taking about 27 minutes and 19 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 28 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 11 minutes. This journey would require five charging stops from 5% to 43%, with a total charging time of 111 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 8 hours and 49 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. This model uses [**GBT**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#gbt) for China and Europe, meaning you must use a CCS2>GBT adapter in Europe. See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

HiPhi X 4 Seater features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).


### Suspension

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 150 mm, and the maximum is 200 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the HiPhi X 4 Seater. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as a standard feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes).


### Regenerative braking

However, it is not considered full one-pedal driving since, at low speeds, the vehicle will keep rolling until it comes to a stop by itself.

## Exterior

### Safety systems



The HiPhi X 4 Seater has an [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The HiPhi X 4 Seater has an [**Electronic Stability Control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/electronicstabilitycontrol/)  as a standard system designed to improve a vehicle's stability and handling during sudden maneuvers or slippery road conditions.

The HiPhi X 4 Seater has a [**lane-keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has a [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Front Cross Traffic Assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/frontcrosstrafficassist/) is a standard driver assist system that helps drivers detect oncoming traffic when crossing an intersection or turning left or right from a stopped position.

[**Forward Collision Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/) is a standard driver assist system to help drivers avoid or mitigate frontal collisions.

The HiPhi X 4 Seater has [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/) as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.

[**Blind-spot monitoring**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/blindspotmonitoring/) is a standard driver-assist system. This side assist system helps to detect traffic in blind spots.

[**Exit Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/exitwarning/) is a standard driver-assist system designed to warn occupants against opening doors if there is a risk of hitting something.

### Driving Automation



With the   level 2 system, you get the following driving automation features.
