We have separated our HiPhi X 6 Seater article into sections. If you want to wait to read the full article, click the links below to the different areas. We also have an overview of the [full specifications](specifications), an [image gallery](gallery), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve), and some [online reviews](reviews). Our sections:

## Performance

The HiPhi X 6 Seater has a maximum power of 433KW (589hp). The total torque is 820nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 3,9 seconds. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 101kWh and a net capacity of 97kWh, meaning you have a 4kWh buffer for protection. (4,0%). The battery is a Lithium-Ion battery based on [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)  The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 460 km (286 mi).   The consumption is 21,1kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 79 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 41 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 4% to 51% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 100kW. Each charge session would take 27 minutes and 19 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 28kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 11 minutes to drive. This trip will require five charge session(s) charging from 5% to 43%. The total time lost for charging will be 111 minutes.

## Drivetrain

HiPhi X 6 Seater has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motor(s) used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/). 

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is standard. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.  

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). 



## Exterior

You can choose between 5 different paint colors when ordering this model. 

The car has two [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) in front, a special combination of sucide doors with gullwing roof on second row and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate) in the rear. 

There is only one roof for this model. 

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted.

### Safety systems



The HiPhi X 6 Seater has a [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The HiPhi X 6 Seater has a [**Electronic Stability Control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/electronicstabilitycontrol/)  as a standard system that is designed to improve the stability and handling of a vehicle during sudden maneuvers or slippery road conditions.

The HiPhi X 6 Seater has a [**lane keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Front Cross Traffic Assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/frontcrosstrafficassist/) is a standard driver assist system that helps drivers detect oncoming traffic when crossing an intersection or turning left or right from a stopped position. 

[**Forward Collision Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/) is a standard driver assist system that is designed to help drivers avoid or mitigate frontal collisions. 

The HiPhi X 6 Seater has a [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/)  as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.

[**Blind spot monitoring**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/blindspotmonitoring/) is a standard driver assist system. This side assist system helps to detect traffic in blind spots.

## Cargo Capacity and Towing Ability

The cargo capacity in the trunk is 204 liters. With the third row seat down, it is 587 liters. 

This model is not available with a towbar. So if you need to pull a trailer, you must look at other models.
