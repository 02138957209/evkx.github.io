## Performance

The HiPhi X 6 Seater has a maximum power of 433KW (589hp). The total torque is 410nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 3,9 seconds. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 97kWh and a net capacity of 92kWh, meaning you have a 5kWh buffer for protection. (5,2%).  The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 460 km (286 mi).   The consumption is 20,0kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 231 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 51 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 8% to 45% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 89kW. Each charge session would take 23 minutes and 51 seconds.

### Safety systems



The HiPhi X 6 Seater has a [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The HiPhi X 6 Seater has a [**lane keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Front Cross Traffic Assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/frontcrosstrafficassist/) is a standard driver assist system that helps drivers detect oncoming traffic when crossing an intersection or turning left or right from a stopped position. 

[**Forward Collision Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/) is a standard driver assist system that is designed to help drivers avoid or mitigate frontal collisions. 

The HiPhi X 6 Seater has a [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/)  as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.

[**Blind spot monitoring**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/blindspotmonitoring/) is a standard driver assist system. This side assist system helps to detect traffic in blind spots.

### Driving Automation



With the standard system the model offers no driving automation. 
- [**Adaptive Cruise control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/adaptivecruisecontrol/) 
- [**Autosteer**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/autosteer/): keeps the car in your lane and slows down if needed in traffic. The system limits how long you can drive without touching the steering wheel.
