## Performance

The Lotus Eletre S packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 450 kW (612 hp / 604 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 710 Nm (524 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 4.5 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 258 km/h (160 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 112 kWh and a net usable capacity of 109 kWh, providing an 3 kWh buffer (2.7%) for battery protection.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 535 to 490 km (333-305 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels, for instance, can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 20.4 kWh/100 km for the base model and 22.2 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 350 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 50 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 20 minutes with an average charging speed at 230 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 68%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 193 kW, with each charging session taking about 23 minutes and 45 seconds.. This exceptionally fast charging capability makes the Lotus Eletre S one of the most efficient and convenient EVs for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 27 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 10 minutes. This journey would require two charging stops from 1% to 75%, with a total charging time of 51 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 22 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 4 hours and 57 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

Lotus Eletre S features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The front suspension and rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 162 mm, and the maximum is 212 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Lotus Eletre S. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as a standard feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes

You can choose between different brake systems. The standard option brakes use a [cast-iron disc coated with tungsten carbide](../../../../technology/brakes/#carbid-brakes). It doesn't rust and produces hardly any brake dust. The front discs are 412mm, and the rear discs are 397mm. The second option brakes uses [ceramic discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#ceramic-brakes). The front discs are 412mm, and the rear discs are 397mm.

### Regenerative braking

[**Automatic regeneration**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. However, [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [**blended brakes**](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal). However, it is not considered full one-pedal driving since, at low speeds, the vehicle will keep rolling until it comes to a stop by itself.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are three levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

## Exterior

The Lotus Eletre S, with dimensions of 5105 mm in length,  mm in width, and 1630 mm in height, falls into the Full-size SUVs offer the most space, power, and capability among SUV categories, making them suitable for a specific set of drivers with unique needs The Lotus Eletre S is available in a total of 6 paint colors, including several striking metallic options.

You can select from multiple wheel options in different sizes on the Lotus Eletre S, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 275/40 tires on 22" rims front and 315/35 tires on 22" rims rear
- 285/35 tires on 23" rims front and 325/30 tires on 23" rims rear

More narrow wheels will improve consumption and give a longer range, while wider wheels will provide better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [hatchback-style liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#hatcback-style-liftgate).

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a large panoramic roof extending over most of the areas from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass has an electrochromic function that lets you blend the glass in multiple levels to protect against the sun.

Additionally, you can order the car with tinted windows from the B-pillar backward, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.

## Cargo Capacity and Towing Ability

The trunk offers a cargo capacity of 688 liters (24.3 CU FT). With the rear seat folded down, this expands to 1532 liters (54.1 CU FT). On the roof, you can load up to 75 kg (165.3 lbs). Additionally, there is a frunk (front trunk) with a storage capacity of 46 liters (1.6 CU FT).

The vehicle’s maximum weight is 3100 kg (6834 lbs), with a base weight of 2640 kg (5820 lbs). This allows for a maximum load of 460 kg (1014 lbs), including the driver and passengers. Note that some options may increase the base weight and reduce the maximum loading capacity. 460kg is considered low for this type of car and might restrict how much stuff you can bring in addition to passengers.

A towbar can be added to the vehicle. The maximum permissible weight for a braked trailer is 2250 kg (4960 lbs), while for an unbraked trailer, it is 750 kg (1653 lbs).
