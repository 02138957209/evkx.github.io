## Performance

The Lotus Eletre R has a maximum power of 675KW (918hp). The total torque is 985nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 2,9 seconds. The top speed is 260 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 112kWh and a net capacity of 107kWh, meaning you have a 5kWh buffer for protection. (4,5%). The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 460 to 410 km (286-255 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 23,3kWh/100km for the basic version and 26,1kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 98 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 41 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 26% to 70% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 111kW. Each charge session would take 25 minutes and 25 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 30kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 6 minutes to drive. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 25% to 71%. The total time lost for charging will be 106 minutes.   

### Onboard charger



### Charge port

The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Lotus Eletre R has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. 

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 204 mm, and the max is 194 mm. 

### Steering

Dynamic steering is standard on the Lotus Eletre R. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is standard. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.  

### Brakes





## Exterior

You can choose between 6 different paint colors when ordering this model. 

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [boot lid]](../../../../technology/doors/#boot-lid) for the trunk.
