## Performance

The BYD Tang EV600 delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 380 kW (517 hp / 510 bhp) and a total torque of 680 Nm (502 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 4.6 seconds and reaches a top speed of 180 km/h (112 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 90.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 86.4 kWh, providing a 3.6 kWh buffer (4.0%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 640 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. The Lithium-Ion battery uses [LFP technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp) This has some benefits and disadvantages from the typical NCA/NCM batteries.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 400 km (249 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 21.6 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 110 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 67 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 36 minutes with an average charging speed of 100 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 4% to 59%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 93 kW, with each charging session taking about 31 minutes and 37 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 31.7 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 50 minutes. This journey would require five charging stops from 5% to 59%, with a total charging time of 150 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 7.4 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 11 hours and 40 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The BYD Tang EV600 features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/) at the front axle and [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/) at the rear axle.

### Suspension

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 190 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the BYD Tang EV600, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort.

### Brakes

The  is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear.

### Regenerative Braking

[**Automatic regeneration**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. However, [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [**blended brakes**](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal). However, it is not considered full one-pedal driving since, at low speeds, the vehicle will keep rolling until it comes to a stop by itself.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are two levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

The maximum regenerative power is 200 kW.

## Exterior

The BYD Tang EV600, with dimensions of 4870 mm in length, 1950 mm in width, and 1725 mm in height, falls into the Mid-size SUVs offer a blend of space, comfort, performance, and versatility, making them suitable for a wide range of drivers with diverse needs. The BYD Tang EV600 is available in a total of 5 solid paint colors.

You can select from multiple wheel designs, all available in the same size, on the BYD Tang EV600, allowing you to personalize your vehicle to match your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 265/40 tires on 22" rims

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). The liftgate is electric-powered and has a kick-sensor as standard.

There is only one roof option for this model. The standard roof has a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

The windows from the B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
