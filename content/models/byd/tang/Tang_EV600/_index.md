## Performance

The BYD Tang EV600 delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 380 kW (517 hp / 510 bhp) and a total torque of 680 Nm (502 lb-ft). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 4.6 seconds and reaches a top speed of 180 km/h (112 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 90 kWh and a net usable capacity of 86,4 kWh, providing an 3,6 kWh buffer (4.0%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 640 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 400 km (249 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 21.6 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 110 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 67 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 36 minutes with an average charging speed at 100 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 4% to 59%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 93 kW, with each charging session taking about 31 minutes and 37 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 31.7 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 50 minutes. This journey would require five charging stops from 5% to 59%, with a total charging time of 150 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 7 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 12 hours and 20 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

BYD Tang EV600 features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/) at the front axle and [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/) at the rear axle.


### Suspension

The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 190 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the BYD Tang EV600. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes).


### Regenerative braking

[**Automatic regeneration**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. However, [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [**blended brakes**](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal).

The maximum regenerative power is 200 kW.

## Exterior

The BYD Tang EV600, with dimensions of 4870 mm in length, 1950 mm in width, and 1725 mm in height, falls into the Mid-size SUVs offer a blend of space, comfort, performance, and versatility, making them suitable for a wide range of drivers with diverse needs. The BYD Tang EV600 is available in a total of 5 solid paint colors.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate).

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof has a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.

### Safety systems



The BYD Tang EV600 has an [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The BYD Tang EV600 has an [**Electronic Stability Control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/electronicstabilitycontrol/)  as a standard system designed to improve a vehicle's stability and handling during sudden maneuvers or slippery road conditions.

The BYD Tang EV600 has a [**lane-keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has a [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Front Cross Traffic Assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/frontcrosstrafficassist/) is an optional driver assist system that helps drivers detect oncoming traffic when crossing an intersection or turning left or right from a stopped position.

[**Rear Cross Traffic Alert**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/rearcrosstrafficalert/) is a standard driver assist system that uses sensors to detect approaching vehicles from the side when backing out of a parking space or driveway.

[**Forward Collision Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/) is an optional driver assist system to help drivers avoid or mitigate frontal collisions.

The BYD Tang EV600 has [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/) as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.

[**Automatic emergency steering**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencysteering/) is an optional  driver assist system designed to help drivers avoid collisions by automatically steering the vehicle in an emergency.

[**Blind-spot monitoring**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/blindspotmonitoring/) is a standard driver-assist system. This side assist system helps to detect traffic in blind spots.

### Driving Automation

The BYD Tang EV600 offers [driving automation on level 1 or 2](../../../../technology/driverassistance/#level-of-autonomous-driving), depending on the equipment level.

With the   level 1 system, you get the following driving automation features.
- [**Adaptive Cruise control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/adaptivecruisecontrol/)
