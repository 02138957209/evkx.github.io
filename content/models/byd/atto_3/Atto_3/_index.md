## Performance

The BYD Atto 3 offers modest performance with a maximum power of 150 kW (204 hp / 201 bhp) and a total torque of 310 Nm (229 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 7.3 seconds and has a top speed of 160 km/h (99 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 60,5 kWh and a net usable capacity of 58 kWh, providing an 2,5 kWh buffer (4.1%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 403 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. The Lithium-Ion battery uses [LFP technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp) This has some benefits and disadvantages from the typical NCA/NCM batteries.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 420 km (261 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 13.8 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 88 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 59 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 34 minutes with an average charging speed at 72 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 2% to 63%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 67 kW, with each charging session taking about 32 minutes and 40 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 23 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 55 minutes. This journey would require five charging stops from 3% to 63%, with a total charging time of 156 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 7 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 8 hours and 17 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The charge port is conveniently located on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side), facilitating easy access at charging stations where you park parallel to the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the BYD Atto 3. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes).


### Regenerative braking

[**Automatic regeneration**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. However, [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [**blended brakes**](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal).

The maximum regenerative power is 200 kW.

## Exterior

The BYD Atto 3, with dimensions of 4455 mm in length, 1875 mm in width, and 1875 mm in height, falls into the B-SUV segment cars, also known as subcompact SUVs or crossovers, offer a combination of the compact size and maneuverability of B-segment cars with the higher driving position, increased cargo space, and rugged styling of an SUV. The BYD Atto 3 is available in a total of 4 solid paint colors.

You can select from multiple wheel designs, all available in the same size, on the BYD Atto 3, allowing you to personalize your vehicle to match your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 235/50 tires on 18" rims

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate).

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof has a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
