## Performance

The BYD Atto 3 has a maximum power of 150KW (204hp). The total torque is 310nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 7,3 seconds. The top speed is 160 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 60,5kWh and a net capacity of 58kWh, meaning you have a 2,5kWh buffer for protection. (4,1%).  The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 420 km (261 mi).   The consumption is 13,8kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 88kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 45 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 24 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 3% to 60% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 86kW. Each charge session would take 23 minutes and 58 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 25kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 35 minutes to drive. This trip will require six charge session(s) charging from 3% to 59%. The total time lost for charging will be 135 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 7KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 8 hours and 17 minutes.
