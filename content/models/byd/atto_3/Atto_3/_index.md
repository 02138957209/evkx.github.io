## Performance

The BYD Atto 3 offers modest performance with a maximum power of 150 kW (204 hp / 201 bhp) and a total torque of 310 Nm (229 ft-lb). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 7.3 seconds and has a top speed of 160 km/h (99 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The electric vehicle features a high-capacity battery with a gross capacity of 60,5 kWh and a net usable capacity of 58 kWh, providing an 2,5 kWh buffer (3.6%) for battery protection. The Lithium-Ion battery uses [LFP technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp) This has some benefits and disadvantages from the typical NCA/NCM batteries.

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) is 420 km (261 mi). The consumption is 13.8kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 88 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 59 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 34 minutes with an average charging speed at 72 kW. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 2% to 63%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 67kW. Each charge session would take 32 minutes and 40 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 23kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 55 minutes. This trip will require five charge session(s) charging from 3% to 63%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 156 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 7 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 8 hours and 17 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you park side into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

### Safety systems



The BYD Atto 3 has an [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The BYD Atto 3 has an [**Electronic Stability Control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/electronicstabilitycontrol/)  as a standard system designed to improve a vehicle's stability and handling during sudden maneuvers or slippery road conditions.

The BYD Atto 3 has a [**lane-keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has a [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Front Cross Traffic Assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/frontcrosstrafficassist/) is an optional driver assist system that helps drivers detect oncoming traffic when crossing an intersection or turning left or right from a stopped position.

[**Rear Cross Traffic Alert**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/rearcrosstrafficalert/) is a standard driver assist system that uses sensors to detect approaching vehicles from the side when backing out of a parking space or driveway.

[**Forward Collision Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/) is an optional driver assist system to help drivers avoid or mitigate frontal collisions.

The BYD Atto 3 has [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/) as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.

[**Automatic emergency steering**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencysteering/) is an optional  driver assist system designed to help drivers avoid collisions by automatically steering the vehicle in an emergency.

[**Blind-spot monitoring**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/blindspotmonitoring/) is a standard driver-assist system. This side assist system helps to detect traffic in blind spots.

### Driving Automation

The BYD Atto 3 offers [driving automation on level 1](../../../../technology/driverassistance/#level-of-autonomous-driving), depending on the equipment level.

With the   level 1 system, you get the following driving automation features.
