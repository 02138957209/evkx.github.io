We have separated our BYD Han article into sections. If you want to wait to read the full article, click the links below to the different areas. We also have an overview of the [full specifications](specifications), an [image gallery](gallery), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve), and some [online reviews](reviews). Our sections:

## Performance

The BYD Han has a maximum power of 380KW (517hp). The total torque is 700nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 3,9 seconds. The top speed is 180 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 85,4kWh and a net capacity of 83kWh, meaning you have a 2,4kWh buffer for protection. (2,8%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [LFP technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp) This has some benefits and disadvantages from the typical NCA/NCM batteries.  The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 521 km (324 mi).   The consumption is 15,9kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 120kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 65 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 35 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 4% to 59% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 93kW. Each charge session would take 30 minutes and 36 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 25kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 10 minutes to drive. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 8% to 59%. The total time lost for charging will be 111 minutes.   

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 7KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 11 hours and 51 minutes. 

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This makes it easy for charge stations where you need to back up in to the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

BYD Han has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motor(s) used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/). 



### Steering

Dynamic steering is standard on the BYD Han. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. 

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). 

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available through [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal). [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. 

## Exterior

You can choose between 6 different paint colors when ordering this model. 

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). 

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof has a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the carâ€™s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted.

## Advanced driver assistance systems

The BYD Han has several standard and optional [advanced driver assistance systems](../../../../technology/driverassistance/)  (ADAS) for better safety and comfort.
### Safety systems



The BYD Han has an [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The BYD Han has an [**Electronic Stability Control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/electronicstabilitycontrol/)  as a standard system designed to improve a vehicle's stability and handling during sudden maneuvers or slippery road conditions. 

The BYD Han has a [**lane-keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has a [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Front Cross Traffic Assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/frontcrosstrafficassist/) is a optional driver assist system that helps drivers detect oncoming traffic when crossing an intersection or turning left or right from a stopped position. 

[**Rear Cross Traffic Alert**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/rearcrosstrafficalert/) is a standard driver assist system that uses sensors to detect approaching vehicles from the side when backing out of a parking space or driveway. 

[**Forward Collision Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/) is a optional driver assist system to help drivers avoid or mitigate frontal collisions. 

The BYD Han has an [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/)  as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.

[**Automatic emergency steering**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencysteering/) is a optional  driver assist system designed to help drivers avoid collisions by automatically steering the vehicle in an emergency. 

[**Blind-spot monitoring**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/blindspotmonitoring/) is a standard driver-assist system. This side assist system helps to detect traffic in blind spots. 

### Driving Automation

The BYD Han offers [driving automation on level 1 or 2](../../../../technology/driverassistance/#level-of-autonomous-driving), depending on the equipment level.

With the   level 1 system, you get the following driving automation features. 
- [**Adaptive Cruise control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/adaptivecruisecontrol/) 
- [**Automatic parking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticparking/). (optional) 


With the Smart Pilot  level 2 system, you get additional driving automation features to the ones listed above. 
- [**Autosteer**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/autosteer/): keeps the car in your lane and slows down if needed in traffic. The system limits how long you can drive without touching the steering wheel.

## Cargo Capacity and Towing Ability

The cargo capacity in the trunk is 410 liters. Max weight is 2660kg, and with the base weight of 2250 kg, you can max load 410 kg, including driver and passengers. Some options can increase the base weight and reduce the max loading weight. 

This model is not available with a towbar. So if you need to pull a trailer, you must look at other models.
