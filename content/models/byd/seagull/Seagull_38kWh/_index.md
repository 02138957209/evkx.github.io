## Performance

The BYD Seagull 38kWh kWh provides basic performance with a maximum power of 55 kW (75 hp / 74 bhp) and a total torque of 135 Nm (100 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 13 seconds and reaches a top speed of 130 km/h (81 mph), which is more comparable to entry-level traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 38,8 kWh and a net usable capacity of 37 kWh, providing an 1,8 kWh buffer (4.6%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 403 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. The Lithium-Ion battery uses [LFP technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp) This has some benefits and disadvantages from the typical NCA/NCM batteries.

The vehicle's range, according to the [CLTC](../../../../guides/understandingrange/cltc/) (China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle) standard, is 405 km ( miles). he energy consumption is 9.1 kWh/100 km based on the CLTC standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 40 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 84 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 42 minutes with an average charging speed at 37 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 12% to 75%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 33 kW, with each charging session taking about 42 minutes and 9 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 19 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 12 hours and 58 minutes. This journey would require six charging stops from 10% to 79%, with a total charging time of 279 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 6.6 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 5 hours and 36 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The charge port is conveniently located on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side), facilitating easy access at charging stations where you park parallel to the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
