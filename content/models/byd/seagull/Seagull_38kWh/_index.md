## Performance

The BYD Seagull 38kWh has a maximum power of 55 KW (75 hp/74 bhp). The total torque is 310 nm (229 ft-lb). It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 7 seconds. The top speed is 130 km/h.

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 38kWh and a net capacity of 37kWh, meaning you have a 1kWh buffer for protection. (2,6%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [LFP technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp) This has some benefits and disadvantages from the typical NCA/NCM batteries.

The [CLTC range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/cltc/) is 405 km ( miles). The consumption is 9.1kWh/100km for the CLTC standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 88kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 29 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 16 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 2% to 60%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 77kW. Each charge session would take 17 minutes and 44 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 19kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 19 minutes. This trip will require five charge session(s) charging from 1% to 84%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 119 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 3 hours and 21 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you park side into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
