We also have an overview of the [full specifications](specifications/), an [image gallery](gallery/), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve/), and some [online reviews](reviews/). Our sections:

## Performance

The BYD Seal U Design offers modest performance with a maximum power of 160 kW (218 hp / 215 bhp) and a total torque of 310 Nm (229 ft-lb). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 9.3 seconds and has a top speed of 175 km/h (109 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The electric vehicle features a high-capacity battery with a gross capacity of 87 kWh and a net usable capacity of 87 kWh, providing an 0 kWh buffer (3.6%) for battery protection. The Lithium-Ion battery uses [LFP technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp) This has some benefits and disadvantages from the typical NCA/NCM batteries.

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) is 500 km (311 mi). The consumption is 17.4kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 140 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 72 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 40 minutes with an average charging speed at 90 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 3% to 38%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 95 kW, with each charging session taking about 19 minutes and 8 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 25 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 4 minutes. This journey would require five charging stops from 2% to 40%, with a total charging time of 105 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 54 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

BYD Seal U Design has a front-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the front axle. The motor(s) used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the BYD Seal U Design. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes).

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available through [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal). [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. At low speeds, the one-pedal drive mode will keep the car creeping forward. You can adjust how strong regen you get when you lift the foot. There are two levels.

## Exterior

You can choose between 6 different paint colors when ordering this model.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [boot lid](../../../../technology/doors/#boot-lid) for the trunk.

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof has a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted.

### Second-row seat



The second row has a standard three-seat bench with a 60:40 split where you can fold each section separately to increase the cargo space. In addition, the following functionalities are available.

- electric adjustment
- height adjustable headrest

There is only one type of steering wheel available.

## Climate system

There is one climate system available. The 2-zone climate system supports different temperatures in two zones for the driver and passenger. This model has a [heat pump](../../../../technology/hvac/#heat-pump) as standard. This heat pump can save significant energy that the EV would use for heating in cold weather.

## Comfort

BYD Seal U Design has several features to make your life as a driver or passenger more comfortable.

Keyless entry allows access to the car without needing to find the key. As long you bring it with you, the doors open.

Keyless go makes it possible to start the car without using the key.

The steering wheel is electrically adjustable.

You have wireless charging for your phone.

Behind the steering wheel is a [digital instrument cluster](../../../../technology/userinterface/screens/#digital-instruments), and on the right part, there is an [infotainment screen](../../../../technology/userinterface/screens/#infotainment-screen). The  screen behind the steering wheel mounted into the dashboard is 10.3 inches large. The touch screen on the dashboard's center is 15.6 inches large.
A head-up display is a standard system that presents speed and other important driver information in front of the driver on the windshield.

## Infotainment

### Safety systems



The BYD Seal U Design has an [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The BYD Seal U Design has an [**Electronic Stability Control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/electronicstabilitycontrol/)  as a standard system designed to improve a vehicle's stability and handling during sudden maneuvers or slippery road conditions.

The BYD Seal U Design has a [**lane-keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has a [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Front Cross Traffic Assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/frontcrosstrafficassist/) is an optional driver assist system that helps drivers detect oncoming traffic when crossing an intersection or turning left or right from a stopped position.

[**Rear Cross Traffic Alert**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/rearcrosstrafficalert/) is a standard driver assist system that uses sensors to detect approaching vehicles from the side when backing out of a parking space or driveway.

[**Forward Collision Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/) is a standard driver assist system to help drivers avoid or mitigate frontal collisions.

The BYD Seal U Design has [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/) as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.

[**Automatic emergency steering**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencysteering/) is an optional  driver assist system designed to help drivers avoid collisions by automatically steering the vehicle in an emergency.

[**Blind-spot monitoring**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/blindspotmonitoring/) is a standard driver-assist system. This side assist system helps to detect traffic in blind spots.

### Driving Automation



With the Smart Pilot  level 2 system, you get the following driving automation features.
