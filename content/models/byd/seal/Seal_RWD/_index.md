We've divided the article into specific sections for easier navigation. Click the links below to jump to different areas or read on for the full article. We also have an overview of the [full specifications](specifications/), an [image gallery](gallery/), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve/), and some [online reviews](reviews/). Our sections:

## Performance

The BYD Seal RWD delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 230 kW (313 hp / 308 bhp) and a total torque of 360 Nm (266 lb-ft). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.9 seconds and reaches a top speed of 180 km/h (112 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 85,4 kWh and a net usable capacity of 82,5 kWh, providing an 2,9 kWh buffer (3.4%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 569 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. The Lithium-Ion battery uses [LFP technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp) This has some benefits and disadvantages from the typical NCA/NCM batteries.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 520 km (323 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 15.9 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 150 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 64 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 35 minutes with an average charging speed at 100 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 4% to 59%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 92 kW, with each charging session taking about 29 minutes and 27 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 25 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 10 minutes. This journey would require four charging stops from 8% to 59%, with a total charging time of 110 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 7 hours and 30 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

BYD Seal RWD has a rear-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the rear axle. The motor used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The front suspension employs a [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone) design, while the rear uses a [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink) setup. The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the BYD Seal RWD. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes).

### Regenerative braking

[**Automatic regeneration**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. However, [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [**blended brakes**](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal). At low speeds, the one-pedal drive mode will keep the car creeping forward.

The maximum regenerative power is 200 kW.

## Exterior

The BYD Seal RWD, with dimensions of 4800 mm in length, 1875 mm in width, and 1460 mm in height, falls into D-segment cars, also known as mid-size or family cars, offer more space, comfort, and features than smaller segments, making them suitable for a variety of drivers.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [boot lid](../../../../technology/doors/#boot-lid) for the trunk.

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof includes a large panoramic glass roof extending from the front to the rear, enhancing the interior's spacious and bright feel, thereby improving the mood and comfort of occupants. This glass is tinted to protect against heat from the sun.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
