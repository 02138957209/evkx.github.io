We have separated our BYD Seal RWD article into sections. If you want to wait to read the full article, click the links below to the different areas. We also have an overview of the [full specifications](specifications/), an [image gallery](gallery/), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve/), and some [online reviews](reviews/). Our sections:

## Performance

The BYD Seal RWD has a maximum power of 230 KW (313 hp/308 bhp). The total torque is 360 nm (266 ft-lb). It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 5.9 seconds. The top speed is 180 km/h.

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 85.4kWh and a net capacity of 82.5kWh, meaning you have a 2.9kWh buffer for protection. (3.4%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [LFP technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp) This has some benefits and disadvantages from the typical NCA/NCM batteries.

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) is 520 km (323 mi). The consumption is 15.9kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 150kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 64 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 35 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 4% to 59%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 92kW. Each charge session would take 29 minutes and 27 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 25kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 10 minutes. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 8% to 59%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 110 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 30 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

BYD Seal RWD has a rear-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the rear axle. The motor(s) used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the BYD Seal RWD. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes).

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available through [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal). [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. At low speeds, the one-pedal drive mode will keep the car creeping forward.

## Exterior

You can choose between 6 different paint colors when ordering this model.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [boot lid](../../../../technology/doors/#boot-lid) for the trunk.

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof has a large panoramic roof extending from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car's interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted.

### Safety systems



The BYD Seal RWD has an [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The BYD Seal RWD has an [**Electronic Stability Control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/electronicstabilitycontrol/)  as a standard system designed to improve a vehicle's stability and handling during sudden maneuvers or slippery road conditions.

The BYD Seal RWD has a [**lane-keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has a [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Front Cross Traffic Assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/frontcrosstrafficassist/) is an optional driver assist system that helps drivers detect oncoming traffic when crossing an intersection or turning left or right from a stopped position.

[**Rear Cross Traffic Alert**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/rearcrosstrafficalert/) is a standard driver assist system that uses sensors to detect approaching vehicles from the side when backing out of a parking space or driveway.

[**Forward Collision Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/) is a standard driver assist system to help drivers avoid or mitigate frontal collisions.

The BYD Seal RWD has [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/) as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.

[**Automatic emergency steering**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencysteering/) is an optional  driver assist system designed to help drivers avoid collisions by automatically steering the vehicle in an emergency.

[**Blind-spot monitoring**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/blindspotmonitoring/) is a standard driver-assist system. This side assist system helps to detect traffic in blind spots.

### Driving Automation
