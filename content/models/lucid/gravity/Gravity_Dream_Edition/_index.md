We have separated our Lucid Gravity Dream Edition article into sections. If you want to wait to read the full article, click the links below to the different areas. We also have an overview of the [full specifications](specifications/), an [image gallery](gallery/), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve/), and some [online reviews](reviews/).

## Performance

The Lucid Gravity Dream Edition packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 600 kW (816 hp / 805 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 1000 Nm (738 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 3.5 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 124 kWh and a net usable capacity of 122 kWh, providing an 2 kWh buffer (1.6%) for battery protection.

According to the [EPA](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) (Environmental Protection Agency) standard, the vehicle has an range of 440 miles (708 km) with an energy consumption rate of 3.6 miles per kWh. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of  kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 81 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 34 minutes with an average charging speed at 150 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 45%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 176 kW, with each charging session taking about 18 minutes and 16 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 21 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 8 hours and 51 minutes. This journey would require two charging stops from 1% to 38%, with a total charging time of 31 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 22 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 5 hours and 32 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**NACS**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#nacs) for North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for Europe. See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Lucid Gravity Dream Edition has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motor(s) used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has steel springs with a fixed height, but you can adjust damping to fit your driving style or road condition. The ground clearance with this suspension is 155 mm.

You can order Lucid Gravity Dream Edition with an alternative  suspension. The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 155 mm, and the maximum is 220 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Lucid Gravity Dream Edition. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 386mm, and the rear discs are 381mm.

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available through [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) or coasting is not available in this model. The system stops the car completely using friction brakes.

## Exterior

You can choose between 7 different paint colors when ordering this model.
Additionally, you can choose between 6 wheels with sizes from 20 to 23 inches.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate).

There is only one roof for this model. The windshield is panoramic going back over the first row. In addition there is glasspanel over the second row. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.

This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has a [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Front Cross Traffic Assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/frontcrosstrafficassist/) is a standard driver assist system that helps drivers detect oncoming traffic when crossing an intersection or turning left or right from a stopped position.

[**Automatic emergency steering**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencysteering/) is a standard  driver assist system designed to help drivers avoid collisions by automatically steering the vehicle in an emergency.

[**Blind-spot monitoring**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/blindspotmonitoring/) is a standard driver-assist system. This side assist system helps to detect traffic in blind spots.

### Driving Automation



With the ADAS  level 2 system, you get the following driving automation features.
- [**Adaptive Cruise control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/adaptivecruisecontrol/)
