We have separated our Lucid Air Pure article into sections. If you want to wait to read the full article, click the links below to the different areas. We also have an overview of the [full specifications](specifications), an [image gallery](gallery), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve), and some [online reviews](reviews). Our sections:

## Performance

The Lucid Air Pure has a maximum power of 320KW (435hp). The total torque is 400nm. It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 4,5 seconds. The top speed is 200 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 94kWh and a net capacity of 92kWh, meaning you have a 2kWh buffer for protection. (2,1%). 

 The [EPA range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa) is 410 miles (660 km).   The consumption is 4.5mi/kWh for the EPA standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 61 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 26 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 49%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 163kW. Each charge session would take 16 minutes and 18 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 19kWh/100km, 1000km will take 8 hours and 56 minutes. This trip will require two charge session(s) charging from 0% to 54%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 37 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 22KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 4 hours and 10 minutes. 

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger.  The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
