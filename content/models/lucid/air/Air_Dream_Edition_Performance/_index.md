## Performance

The Lucid Air Dream Edition Performance has a maximum power of 828KW (1126hp). The total torque is 1390nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 2,7 seconds. The top speed is 270 km/h. {{<evkxdisplayaddarticle />}}


## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 118kWh and a net capacity of 117kWh, meaning you have a 1kWh buffer for protection. (0,8%). The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 861 to 828 km (535-515 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 13,6kWh/100km for the basic version and 14,1kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 77 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 33 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 46% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 174kW. Each charge session would take 18 minutes and 7 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 19kWh/100km, 1000km will take 8 hours and 47 minutes to drive. This trip will require two charge session(s) charging from 1% to 33%. The total time lost for charging will be 27 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 22KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 5 hours and 19 minutes. {{<evkxdisplayaddarticle />}}
