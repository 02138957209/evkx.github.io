## Performance

The Lucid Air Dream Edition Range delivers a jaw-dropping maximum power of 696 KW (946 hp/933 bhp) and a massive total torque of 1390 Nm (1026 lb-ft). This powerhouse can rocket from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 2.9 seconds, showcasing its astonishing acceleration. Additionally, it achieves a top speed of 270 km/h (168 mph), making it a true marvel of engineering and performance.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 118 kWh and a net usable capacity of 117 kWh, providing an 1 kWh buffer (0.8%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 800 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 883 to 828 km (549-515 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels, for instance, can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 13.3 kWh/100 km for the base model and 14.1 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. This range is amongst the longest in its class, and the high efficiency makes it one of the most economical vehicles in its category. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of  kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 77 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 33 minutes with an average charging speed at 150 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 46%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 174 kW, with each charging session taking about 18 minutes and 7 seconds.. This efficient charging capability makes the Lucid Air Dream Edition Range a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 19 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 8 hours and 47 minutes. This journey would require two charging stops from 1% to 33%, with a total charging time of 27 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 22 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 5 hours and 19 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

Lucid Air Dream Edition Range features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The  suspension has steel springs with a fixed height, but you can adjust damping to fit your driving style or road condition. The ground clearance with this suspension is 126 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Lucid Air Dream Edition Range. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 380mm, and the rear discs are 375mm.

### Regenerative braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) in this model is primarily facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). Unlike some models, [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) or coasting is not available here. The system stops the car completely using friction brakes.

## Exterior

The Lucid Air Dream Edition Range, with dimensions of 4975 mm in length, 1939 mm in width, and 1410 mm in height, falls into E-segment cars, also known as executive cars, are larger and more luxurious than their D-segment counterparts. They are designed to offer superior comfort, advanced technology, and high performance, making them suitable for a specific set of drivers. You can choose between 4 different paint colors when ordering this model.

You can select from multiple wheel options in different sizes on the Lucid Air Dream Edition Range, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:


- 245/45 tires on 19" rims

- 245/40 tires on 21" rims front and 265/40 tires on 21" rims rear

More narrow wheels will improve consumption and give a longer range, while wider wheels will provide better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [boot lid](../../../../technology/doors/#boot-lid) for the trunk.

There is only one roof for this model. The windshield is panoramic going back over the first row. In addition there is glasspanel over the second row. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.
