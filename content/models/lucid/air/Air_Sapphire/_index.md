We have separated our Lucid Air Sapphire article into sections. If you want to wait to read the full article, click the links below to the different areas. We also have an overview of the [full specifications](specifications/), an [image gallery](gallery/), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve/), and some [online reviews](reviews/). Our sections:

## Performance

The Lucid Air Sapphire has a maximum power of 920 KW (1251 hp/1234 bhp). The total torque is 1390 nm (1026 ft-lb). It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 1,95 seconds. The top speed is 330 km/h.

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 118kWh and a net capacity of 117kWh, meaning you have a 1kWh buffer for protection. (0,8%).

The [EPA range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) is 427 miles (687 km). The consumption is 3.6mi/kWh for the EPA standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 300kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 77 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 33 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 46%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 174kW. Each charge session would take 18 minutes and 7 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 21kWh/100km, 1000km will take 8 hours and 52 minutes. This trip will require two charge session(s) charging from 1% to 41%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 32 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 22 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 5 hours and 19 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
