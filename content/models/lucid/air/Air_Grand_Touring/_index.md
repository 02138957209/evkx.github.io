## Performance

The Lucid Air Grand Touring has a maximum power of 597 KW (812 hp/801 bhp). The total torque is 1200 nm (886 ft-lb). It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 3 seconds. The top speed is 270 km/h.

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 112kWh and a net capacity of 112kWh, meaning you have a 0kWh buffer for protection. (0.0%).

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) varies from 839 to 783 km (521-487 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range. The consumption is between 13.3kWh/100km for the basic version and 14.3kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 74 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 31 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 46%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 172kW. Each charge session would take 18 minutes and 34 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 19kWh/100km, 1000km will take 8 hours and 48 minutes. This trip will require two charge session(s) charging from 1% to 36%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 28 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 22 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 5 hours and 5 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
