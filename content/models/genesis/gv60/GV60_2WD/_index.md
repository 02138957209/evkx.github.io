## Performance

The Genesis GV60 2WD offers modest performance with a maximum power of 168 kW (228 hp / 225 bhp) and a total torque of 350 Nm (258 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.5 seconds and has a top speed of 185 km/h (115 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 77,4 kWh and a net usable capacity of 74 kWh, providing an 3,4 kWh buffer (4.4%) for battery protection.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 517 km (321 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 14.3 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 233 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 38 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 16 minutes with an average charging speed at 192 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 76%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 152 kW, with each charging session taking about 22 minutes and 59 seconds.. This efficient charging capability makes the Genesis GV60 2WD a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 24 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 25 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 1% to 76%, with a total charging time of 66 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 43 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Genesis GV60 2WD has a rear-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the rear axle. The motor(s) used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 161 mm.

### Brakes



[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in two modes. You can use [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) or you can coast and use the [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal) to regen.

## Exterior

You can choose between 10 different paint colors when ordering this model.
Additionally, you can choose between 2 wheels with sizes from 19 to 20 inches.

You can choose between two types of roofs on this model. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a large panoramic roof extending over most of the areas from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

You can order the car with tinted windows from B-pillar and back.

### Safety systems



The Genesis GV60 2WD has an [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The Genesis GV60 2WD has an [**Electronic Stability Control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/electronicstabilitycontrol/)  as a standard system designed to improve a vehicle's stability and handling during sudden maneuvers or slippery road conditions.

The Genesis GV60 2WD has a [**lane-keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has a [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Front Cross Traffic Assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/frontcrosstrafficassist/) is a standard driver assist system that helps drivers detect oncoming traffic when crossing an intersection or turning left or right from a stopped position.

[**Rear Cross Traffic Alert**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/rearcrosstrafficalert/) is a standard driver assist system that uses sensors to detect approaching vehicles from the side when backing out of a parking space or driveway.

The Genesis GV60 2WD has [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/) as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.

[**Automatic emergency steering**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencysteering/) is a standard  driver assist system designed to help drivers avoid collisions by automatically steering the vehicle in an emergency.

[**Blind-spot monitoring**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/blindspotmonitoring/) is a standard driver-assist system. This side assist system helps to detect traffic in blind spots.

### Driving Automation



With the   level 2 system, you get the following driving automation features.
- [**Adaptive Cruise control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/adaptivecruisecontrol/)
- [**Lane Centering Assist (LCA) /AutoSteer**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/autosteer/): keeps the car in your lane and slows down if needed in traffic. The system limits how long you can drive without touching the steering wheel.
- [**Automatic lane change**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automatedlanechange/)
