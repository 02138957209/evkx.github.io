<p>Acura's EV strategy is to skip hybrids and go all-in on EVs, starting with the 2024 ZDX, its first all-electric vehicle. The ZDX is based on General Motorsâ€™ Ultium platform and battery, and will offer two powertrain options: a single-motor rear-wheel drive with 340 horsepower and a dual-motor all-wheel drive with 500 horsepower. The ZDX will also feature a built-in Google system, a Bang & Olufsen sound system, and a Type S performance varian. Acura plans to launch more electric crossovers, sedans, and sports cars in the future, and aims to have EVs make up a larger percentage of its sales than Honda</p>
