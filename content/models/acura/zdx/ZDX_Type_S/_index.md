## Performance

The Acura ZDX Type S delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 373 kW (507 hp / 500 bhp) and a total torque of 737 Nm (544 lb-ft). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 4.6 seconds and reaches a top speed of 210 km/h (131 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 110 kWh and a net usable capacity of 102 kWh, providing an 8 kWh buffer (7.3%) for battery protection.

According to the [EPA](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) (Environmental Protection Agency) standard, the vehicle has an range of 288 miles (463 km) with an energy consumption rate of 2.8 miles per kWh. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of  kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 176 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 32 minutes with an average charging speed at 136 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 8% to 65%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 120 kW, with each charging session taking about 29 minutes and 59 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 25 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 35 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 8% to 57%, with a total charging time of 75 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11.5 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 8 hours and 52 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
