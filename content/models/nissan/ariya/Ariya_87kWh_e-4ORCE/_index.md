## Performance

The Nissan Ariya 87kWh e-4ORCE has a maximum power of 225KW (306hp). The total torque is 600nm. It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 5,7 seconds. The top speed is 200 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 91kWh and a net capacity of 87kWh, meaning you have a 4kWh buffer for protection. (4,4%). 

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) varies from 500 to 459 km (311-285 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 17.4kWh/100km for the basic version and 19.0kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 130kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 63 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 34 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 6% to 59%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 98kW. Each charge session would take 28 minutes and 18 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 26kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 6 minutes. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 7% to 57%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 107 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the standard onboard charger supports up to 7,2KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 12 hours and 4 minutes. 

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you park side into the charger.  The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
