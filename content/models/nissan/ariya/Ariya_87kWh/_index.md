## Performance

The Nissan Ariya 87kWh has a maximum power of 178KW (242hp). The total torque is 300nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 7,5 seconds. The top speed is 160 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 91kWh and a net capacity of 87kWh, meaning you have a 4kWh buffer for protection. (4,4%). Depending on car options, the [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 533 to 475 km (331-295 mi). Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 16,3kWh/100km for the basic version and 18,3kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 130kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 63 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 34 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 6% to 59% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 98kW. Each charge session would take 28 minutes and 18 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 24,5kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 58 minutes to drive. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 6% to 67%. The total time lost for charging will be 98 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the standard onboard charger supports up to 7,2KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 12 hours and 4 minutes.
