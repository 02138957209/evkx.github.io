## Performance

The Nissan Ariya SR has a maximum power of 160KW (218hp). The total torque is 300nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 7,5 seconds. The top speed is 160 kph. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 66kWh and a net capacity of 63kWh, meaning you have a 3kWh buffer for protection. (4,5%). Depending on car options, the [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 403 to 359 km (250-223 mi). Bigger wheels are an example of an option that increases consumption and reduces range.   The consumption is between 15,6kWh/100km for the basic version and 17,5kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 130kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 53 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 31 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 84% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 76kW. Each charge session would take 41 minutes and 3 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 24kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 42 minutes to drive. This will requires four charge sessions charging from 2% to 73%. The total time lost for charging will be 143 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 7,2KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 8 hours and 45 minutes.
