## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 69.9 kWh and a net usable capacity of 67.0 kWh, providing a 2.9 kWh buffer (4.1%) for battery protection. The Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [LFP technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp), offering both benefits and drawbacks compared to typical NCA/NMC batteries.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 420 km (261 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 16.0 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 80 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 137 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 60 minutes with an average charging speed of 47 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 13% to 49%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 51 kW, with each charging session taking about 28 minutes and 27 seconds.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 6.7 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 10 hours and 0 minutes using a home charging setup.
