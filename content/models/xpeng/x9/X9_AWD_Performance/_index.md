## Performance

The XPENG X9 AWD Performance delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 370 kW (503 hp / 496 bhp) and a total torque of 640 Nm (472 lb-ft). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.7 seconds and reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 101,5 kWh and a net usable capacity of 98 kWh, providing an 3,5 kWh buffer (3.4%) for battery protection. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

The vehicle's range, according to the [CLTC](../../../../guides/understandingrange/cltc/) (China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle) standard, is 640 km ( miles). he energy consumption is 15.3 kWh/100 km based on the CLTC standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of  kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 52 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 20 minutes with an average charging speed at 207 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 7% to 60%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 171 kW, with each charging session taking about 18 minutes and 12 seconds.. This exceptionally fast charging capability makes the XPENG X9 AWD Performance one of the most efficient and convenient EVs for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 25 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 13 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 7% to 59%, with a total charging time of 54 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 8 hours and 54 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
