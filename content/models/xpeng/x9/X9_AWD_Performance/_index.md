## Performance

The XPENG X9 AWD Performance has a maximum power of 370 KW (503 hp/496 bhp). The total torque is 640 nm (472 ft-lb). It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 5,7 seconds. The top speed is 200 km/h.

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 101,5kWh and a net capacity of 98kWh, meaning you have a 3,5kWh buffer for protection. (3,4%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

The [CLTC range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/cltc/) is 640 km ( miles). The consumption is 15.3kWh/100km for the CLTC standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 52 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 20 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 7% to 60%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 171kW. Each charge session would take 18 minutes and 12 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 25kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 13 minutes. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 7% to 59%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 54 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 8 hours and 54 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
