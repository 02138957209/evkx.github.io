## Performance

The XPENG G3i offers modest performance with a maximum power of 145 kW (197 hp / 194 bhp) and a total torque of 300 Nm (221 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 8.6 seconds and has a top speed of 170 km/h (106 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 66 kWh and a net usable capacity of 55,9 kWh, providing an 10,1 kWh buffer (15.3%) for battery protection.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 420 km (261 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 13.3 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 50 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 89 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 51 minutes with an average charging speed at 46 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 8% to 79%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 42 kW, with each charging session taking about 57 minutes and 43 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 25 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 12 hours and 59 minutes. This journey would require five charging stops from 9% to 79%, with a total charging time of 280 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 6.6 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 8 hours and 28 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

XPENG G3i has a front-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the front axle.

### Suspension

The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 130 mm.

### Brakes

### Regenerative braking


## Exterior

The XPENG G3i, with dimensions of 4495 mm in length, 1820 mm in width, and 1610 mm in height, falls into the B-SUV segment cars, also known as subcompact SUVs or crossovers, offer a combination of the compact size and maneuverability of B-segment cars with the higher driving position, increased cargo space, and rugged styling of an SUV. You can choose between 1 different paint colors when ordering this model.

You can select from multiple wheel options in different sizes on the XPENG G3i, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 215/55 tires on 17" rims
- 215/55 tires on 18" rims

More narrow wheels will improve consumption and give a longer range, while wider wheels will provide better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [boot lid](../../../../technology/doors/#boot-lid) for the trunk.

There is only one roof for this model.
