## Performance

The XPENG G3i has a maximum power of 145 KW (197 hp/194 bhp). The total torque is 300 nm (221 ft-lb). It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 8,6 seconds. The top speed is 170 km/h.

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 66kWh and a net capacity of 55,9kWh, meaning you have a 10,1kWh buffer for protection. (15,3%).

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) is 420 km (261 mi). The consumption is 13.3kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 89 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 51 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 8% to 79%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 42kW. Each charge session would take 57 minutes and 43 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 25kWh/100km, 1000km will take 12 hours and 59 minutes. This trip will require five charge session(s) charging from 9% to 79%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 280 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 6,6 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 8 hours and 28 minutes.

### Charge port

The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
