## Performance

The XPENG G6 RWD Standard Range delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 218 kW (296 hp / 292 bhp) and a total torque of 440 Nm (325 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.9 seconds and reaches a top speed of 202 km/h (126 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 67.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 66.0 kWh, providing a 1.0 kWh buffer (1.5%) for battery protection. The Lithium-Ion battery uses [LFP technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp) This has some benefits and disadvantages from the typical NCA/NCM batteries.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 435 km (270 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 15.2 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 215 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 43 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 18 minutes with an average charging speed of 157 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 7% to 60%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 124 kW, with each charging session taking about 17 minutes and 54 seconds. This efficient charging capability makes the XPENG G6 RWD Standard Range a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 25 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 49 minutes. This journey would require five charging stops from 7% to 63%, with a total charging time of 89 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 6 hours and 0 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The XPENG G6 RWD Standard Range has a rear-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the rear axle. The motors used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The front suspension employs a [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone) design, while the rear uses a [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink) setup. The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 160 mm.

### Brakes

The  is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear.

### Regenerative Braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in two modes. You can use [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) or you can coast and use the [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal) to regen. The system stops the car completely using friction brakes.

## Exterior

The XPENG G6 RWD Standard Range, with dimensions of 4753 mm in length, 1920 mm in width, and 1650 mm in height, falls into the Compact SUVs category, also known as C-SUVs. These offer a balance between the practicality and maneuverability of smaller vehicles and the space and versatility of larger SUVs. You can choose between 5 different paint colors when ordering this model.

You can select from multiple wheel designs, all available in the same size, on the XPENG G6 RWD Standard Range, allowing you to personalize your vehicle to match your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 255/45 tires on 20" rims

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [hatchback-style liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#hatcback-style-liftgate).

There is only one roof option for this model. The standard roof has a large panoramic roof extending over most of the areas from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

The windows from the B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
