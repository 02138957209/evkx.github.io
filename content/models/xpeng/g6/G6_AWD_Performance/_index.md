## Performance

The XPENG G6 AWD Performance delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 358 kW (487 hp / 480 bhp) and a total torque of 660 Nm (487 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 3.9 seconds and reaches a top speed of 202 km/h (126 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 92.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 87.5 kWh, providing a 4.5 kWh buffer (4.9%) for battery protection. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc).

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 550 km (342 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 15.9 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 300 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 49 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 21 minutes with an average charging speed of 179 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 6% to 59%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 152 kW, with each charging session taking about 18 minutes and 20 seconds. This efficient charging capability makes the XPENG G6 AWD Performance a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 23 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 17 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 6% to 61%, with a total charging time of 57 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 7 hours and 57 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

### Bidirectional Charging

This model supports V2L (Vehicle to Load), allowing you to power electrical equipment requiring up to 3.3 kW of power, including the ability to charge other vehicles.
