We've divided the article into specific sections for easier navigation. Click the links below to jump to different areas or read on for the full article. We also have an overview of the [full specifications](specifications/), an [image gallery](gallery/), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve/), and some [online reviews](reviews/).

## Performance

The SKODA Enyaq iV80x offers modest performance with a maximum power of 195 kW (265 hp / 262 bhp) and a total torque of 425 Nm (314 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 6.9 seconds and has a top speed of 160 km/h (99 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 82 kWh and a net usable capacity of 77 kWh, providing an 5 kWh buffer (6.1%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 350 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 504 km (313 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 15.3 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 135 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 62 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 35 minutes with an average charging speed at 94 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 2% to 43%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 101 kW, with each charging session taking about 19 minutes and 43 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 23 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 51 minutes. This journey would require five charging stops from 2% to 42%, with a total charging time of 91 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 7 hours and 0 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
