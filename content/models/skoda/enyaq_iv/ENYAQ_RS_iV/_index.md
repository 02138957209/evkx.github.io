## Performance

With overboost, the SKODA ENYAQ RS iV has a maximum power of 220KW (299hp). Without overboost, it is 195KW (265hp). The torque is 460nm with overboost and 425 without overboost. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 6,5 seconds with overboost and 6,9 seconds without overboost. The top speed is 180 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 82kWh and a net capacity of 77kWh, meaning you have a 5kWh buffer for protection. (6,1%). 

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 514 to 496 km (319-308 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 15,0kWh/100km for the basic version and 15,5kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 135kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 62 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 35 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 2% to 43% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 101kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 43 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 21kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 40 minutes to drive. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 2% to 46%. The total time lost for charging will be 80 minutes.   

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 0 minutes. 

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This makes it easy for charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

SKODA ENYAQ RS iV has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motor(s) used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/). 

The Sport suspension has steel springs with a fixed height but an optional damping adjustment. The ground clearance with this suspension is 173 mm. 

### Steering

Dynamic steering is standard on the SKODA ENYAQ RS iV. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. 

### Brakes



[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in several modes. The most efficient is [automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive). In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking to reduce speed. You can also enable [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). 

## Exterior

You can choose between 9 different paint colors when ordering this model. 
Additionally, you can choose between 2 wheels with sizes from 20 to 21 inches. 

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). 

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof has a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the carâ€™s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted.

### Safety systems



The SKODA ENYAQ RS iV has an [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The SKODA ENYAQ RS iV has an [**Electronic Stability Control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/electronicstabilitycontrol/)  as a standard system designed to improve a vehicle's stability and handling during sudden maneuvers or slippery road conditions. 

The SKODA ENYAQ RS iV has a [**lane-keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has a [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Front Cross Traffic Assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/frontcrosstrafficassist/) is a standard driver assist system that helps drivers detect oncoming traffic when crossing an intersection or turning left or right from a stopped position. 

[**Forward Collision Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/) is a standard driver assist system to help drivers avoid or mitigate frontal collisions. 

The SKODA ENYAQ RS iV has an [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/)  as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.
