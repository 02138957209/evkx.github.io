## Performance

With overboost, the SKODA ENYAQ RS iV has a maximum power of 220KW (299hp). Without overboost, it is 195KW (265hp). The torque is 460nm with overboost and 425 without overboost. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 6,5 seconds with overboost and 6,9 seconds without overboost. The top speed is 180 kph. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 82kWh and a net capacity of 77kWh, meaning you have a 5kWh buffer for protection. (6,1%). Depending on car options, the [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 514 to 496 km (319-308 mi). Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 15,0kWh/100km for the basic version and 15,5kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 135kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 62 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 35 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 2% to 43% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 101kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 43 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 21kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 40 minutes to drive. This will requires four charge sessions charging from 2% to 46%. The total time lost for charging will be 80 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 0 minutes.

### Steering
