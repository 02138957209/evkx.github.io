## Performance

The SKODA ENYAQ COUPÉ 85x has a maximum power of 210 KW (286 hp/282 bhp) and a total torque of 679 nm (501 ft-lb). It can sprint from 0 to 100km/h (0 to 62mph) in 6.6 seconds and has a top speed of 180 km/h (112 mph).

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 82kWh and a net capacity of 77kWh, meaning you have a 5kWh buffer for protection. (6.1%).

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) varies from 545 to 527 km (339-328 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range. The consumption is between 14.1kWh/100km for the basic version and 14.6kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 135kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 62 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 35 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 2% to 43%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 101kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 43 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 21kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 40 minutes. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 2% to 46%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 80 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 0 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

SKODA ENYAQ COUPÉ 85x has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/) at the front axle and [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/) at the rear axle.

The Sport suspension has steel springs with a fixed height but an optional damping adjustment. The ground clearance with this suspension is 173 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the SKODA ENYAQ COUPÉ 85x. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed.

### Brakes



[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in several modes. The most efficient is [automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive). In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking to reduce speed. You can also enable [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). At low speeds, the one-pedal drive mode will keep the car rolling until it stops by itself.

## Exterior

You can choose between 9 different paint colors when ordering this model.
Additionally, you can choose between 2 wheels with sizes from 20 to 21 inches.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate).

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof has a large panoramic roof extending from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car's interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted.
