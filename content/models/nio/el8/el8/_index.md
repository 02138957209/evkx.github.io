## Performance

The Nio EL8 packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 480 kW (653 hp / 644 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 850 Nm (627 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 4.1 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

Nio EL8 has two battery options with different specifications. Below you see how this affects range and charging.
### 100kWh

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 100 kWh and a net usable capacity of 90 kWh, providing an 10 kWh buffer (10.0%) for battery protection.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 510 to 493 km (317-306 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels, for instance, can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 17.6 kWh/100 km for the base model and 18.3 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 240 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 75 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 41 minutes with an average charging speed at 91 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 44%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 86 kW, with each charging session taking about 27 minutes and 2 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 30 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 47 minutes. This journey would require six charging stops from 1% to 40%, with a total charging time of 147 minutes.
### 75kWh

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 75 kWh and a net usable capacity of 70,5 kWh, providing an 4,5 kWh buffer (6.0%) for battery protection.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 390 to 379 km (242-236 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels, for instance, can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 17.6 kWh/100 km for the base model and 18.3 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 140 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 65 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 34 minutes with an average charging speed at 87 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 7% to 74%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 77 kW, with each charging session taking about 37 minutes and 57 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 30 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 11 hours and 22 minutes. This journey would require five charging stops from 7% to 73%, with a total charging time of 182 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 8 hours and 10 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you park side into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
### Battery swap

This model support battery swap. Battery swap means you can drive to a unique battery swap station and get the battery replaced with a new battery with 90% SOC. The battery swap takes 7 minutes.
