## Performance

The Nio ES8 has a maximum power of 400KW (544hp). The total torque is 725nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 4,9 seconds. The top speed is 200 kph. 

## Battery, range, and charging

Nio ES8 has two battery options with different specifications. Below you see how this affects range and charging. 
### 100kWh

The battery has a gross capacity of 100kWh and a net capacity of 90kWh, meaning you have a 10kWh buffer for protection. (10,0%).  The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 460 km (286 mi).   The consumption is 19,6kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 120kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 83 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 43 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 7% to 72% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 79kW. Each charge session would take 44 minutes and 24 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 30kWh/100km, 1000km will take 11 hours and 1 minutes to drive. This will requires four charge sessions charging from 8% to 67%. The total time lost for charging will be 162 minutes.   
### 75kWh

The battery has a gross capacity of 75kWh and a net capacity of 69kWh, meaning you have a 6kWh buffer for protection. (8,0%).  The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 350 km (218 mi).   The consumption is 19,6kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 120kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 63 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 33 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 7% to 74% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 76kW. Each charge session would take 36 minutes and 17 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 30kWh/100km, 1000km will take 11 hours and 21 minutes to drive. This will requires five charge sessions charging from 7% to 74%. The total time lost for charging will be 181 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 8 hours and 10 minutes. 
### Battery swap

This model support battery swap. Battery swap means you can drive to a unique battery swap station and get the battery replaced with a new battery with 90% SOC. The battery swap takes 7 minutes. 

## Drivetrain

Nio ES8 has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors. One on each axle. 

The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. Minimum ground clearance is 111 mm and max 161 mm. 

### Steering

Dynamic steering is standard on Nio ES8. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. 

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are cast-iron discs. 

Regenerative braking is available in several modes. The most efficient is automatic regen. In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking when it needs to reduce speed. You can also enable one-pedal driving. 

## Exterior

You can choose between 5 different paint colors when ordering this model. 
Additionally, you can choose between 4 wheels with sizes from 19 to 21 inches. 

The car has four regular doors and a tailgate. The tailgate is electric-powered and has a kick-sensor as standard.
