## Performance

The Nio ES8 has a maximum power of 400KW (544hp). The total torque is 725nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 4,9 seconds. The top speed is 200 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

Nio ES8 has two battery options with different specifications. Below you see how this affects range and charging. 
### 100kWh

The battery has a gross capacity of 100kWh and a net capacity of 90kWh, meaning you have a 10kWh buffer for protection. (10,0%).  The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 460 km (286 mi).   The consumption is 19,6kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 120kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 83 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 43 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 7% to 72% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 79kW. Each charge session would take 44 minutes and 24 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 30kWh/100km, 1000km will take 11 hours and 1 minutes to drive. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 8% to 67%. The total time lost for charging will be 162 minutes.   
### 75kWh

The battery has a gross capacity of 75kWh and a net capacity of 69kWh, meaning you have a 6kWh buffer for protection. (8,0%).  The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 350 km (218 mi).   The consumption is 19,6kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 120kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 63 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 33 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 7% to 74% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 76kW. Each charge session would take 36 minutes and 17 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 30kWh/100km, 1000km will take 11 hours and 21 minutes to drive. This trip will require five charge session(s) charging from 7% to 74%. The total time lost for charging will be 181 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 8 hours and 10 minutes. 
### Battery swap

This model support battery swap. Battery swap means you can drive to a unique battery swap station and get the battery replaced with a new battery with 90% SOC. The battery swap takes 7 minutes. 

## Drivetrain

Nio ES8 has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/) at front axle and [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/) at rear axle. 

The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 111 mm, and the max is 161 mm. 

### Steering

Dynamic steering is standard on the Nio ES8. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. 

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). 

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in several modes. The most efficient is [automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive). In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking to reduce speed. You can also enable [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). 

## Exterior

You can choose between 5 different paint colors when ordering this model. 
Additionally, you can choose between 4 wheels with sizes from 19 to 21 inches. 

The car has four regular doors and a tailgate. The tailgate is electric-powered and has a kick-sensor as standard. 

There is only one roof for this model. The standard is a panoramic roof.

## Advanced driver assistance systems

The Nio ES8 has several standard and optional [advanced driver assistance systems](../../../../technology/driverassistance/)  (ADAS) for better safety and comfort.
### Safety systems



The Nio ES8 has a [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The Nio ES8 has a [**Electronic Stability Control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/electronicstabilitycontrol/)  as a standard system that is designed to improve the stability and handling of a vehicle during sudden maneuvers or slippery road conditions.

The Nio ES8 has a [**lane keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Front Cross Traffic Assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/frontcrosstrafficassist/) is a optional driver assist system that helps drivers detect oncoming traffic when crossing an intersection or turning left or right from a stopped position. 

[**Rear Cross Traffic Alert**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/rearcrosstrafficalert/) is a standard driver assist system that uses sensors to detect approaching vehicles from the side when backing out of a parking space or driveway. 

[**Forward Collision Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/) is a optional driver assist system that is designed to help drivers avoid or mitigate frontal collisions. 

The Nio ES8 has a [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/)  as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.

[**Automatic emergency steering**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencysteering/) is a optional  driver assist system designed to help drivers avoid collisions by automatically steering the vehicle in an emergency. 

[**Blind spot monitoring**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/blindspotmonitoring/) is a standard driver assist system. This side assist system helps to detect traffic in blind spots. 

### Driving Automation

The Nio ES8 offers [driving automation on level 1 or 2](../../../../technology/driverassistance/#level-of-autonomous-driving), depending on the equipment level.

With the NIO Pilot Selected Pack  level 1 system, you get the following driving automation features. 
- [**Adaptive Cruise control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/adaptivecruisecontrol/) 
- [**Automatic parking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticparking/). (optional) 


With the NIO Pilot Complete Pack  level 2 system, you get additional driving automation features to the ones listed above. 
- [**Autosteer**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/autosteer/): keeps the car in your lane and slows down if needed in traffic. The system limits how long you can drive without touching the steering wheel. 
- Advance cruise control that follows navigation and turns off and on major roads to reach the target by itself. 


## Transportation capabilities

The cargo capacity in the trunk is 310 liters. With the rear seat down, it is 1901 liters. On the roof, you can load up to 100kg. Max weight is 3099kg, and with the base weight of 2440 kg, you can max load 659 kg, including driver and passengers. Some options can increase the base weight and reduce the max loading weight. 

You can order the car with a towbar. The maximum total weight on a braked trailer is 1500, and on unbraked, 750kg.
