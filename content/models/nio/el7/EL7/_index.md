## Performance

The Nio EL7 has a maximum power of 480KW (653hp). The total torque is 850nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 3,9 seconds. The top speed is 200 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

Nio EL7 has two battery options with different specifications. Below you see how this affects range and charging. 
### 100kWh

The battery has a gross capacity of 100kWh and a net capacity of 90kWh, meaning you have a 10kWh buffer for protection. (10,0%). Depending on car options, the [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 513 to 486 km (319-302 mi). Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 17,5kWh/100km for the basic version and 18,5kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 126kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 83 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 43 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 7% to 72% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 79kW. Each charge session would take 44 minutes and 24 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 27kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 37 minutes to drive. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 7% to 74%. The total time lost for charging will be 137 minutes.   
### 75kWh

The battery has a gross capacity of 75kWh and a net capacity of 70,5kWh, meaning you have a 4,5kWh buffer for protection. (6,0%). Depending on car options, the [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 394 to 372 km (245-231 mi). Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 17,5kWh/100km for the basic version and 18,5kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 140kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 65 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 34 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 7% to 74% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 77kW. Each charge session would take 37 minutes and 57 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 27kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 56 minutes to drive. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 6% to 77%. The total time lost for charging will be 157 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 8 hours and 10 minutes. 
### Battery swap

This model support battery swap. Battery swap means you can drive to a unique battery swap station and get the battery replaced with a new battery with 90% SOC. The battery swap takes 7 minutes. 

## Drivetrain

Nio EL7 has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors. One on each axle. 

The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. Minimum ground clearance is 143 mm and max 198 mm. 

### Steering

Dynamic steering is standard on Nio EL7. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. 

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are cast-iron discs. 

Regenerative braking is available in several modes. The most efficient is automatic regen. In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking when it needs to reduce speed. You can also enable one-pedal driving.
