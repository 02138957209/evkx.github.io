## Performance

The Nio EL7 has a maximum power of 480 KW (653 hp/644 bhp) and a total torque of 850 nm (627 ft-lb). It can sprint from 0 to 100km/h (0 to 62mph) in 3.9 seconds and has a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph).

## Battery, range, and charging

Nio EL7 has two battery options with different specifications. Below you see how this affects range and charging.
### 100kWh

The battery has a gross capacity of 100kWh and a net capacity of 90kWh, meaning you have a 10kWh buffer for protection. (10.0%).

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) varies from 513 to 486 km (319-302 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range. The consumption is between 17.5kWh/100km for the basic version and 18.5kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 126kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 75 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 41 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 44%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 86kW. Each charge session would take 27 minutes and 2 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 25.5kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 15 minutes. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 1% to 47%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 116 minutes.
### 75kWh

The battery has a gross capacity of 75kWh and a net capacity of 70,5kWh, meaning you have a 4,5kWh buffer for protection. (6.0%).

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) varies from 394 to 372 km (245-231 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range. The consumption is between 17.5kWh/100km for the basic version and 18.5kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 140kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 65 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 34 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 7% to 74%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 77kW. Each charge session would take 37 minutes and 57 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 25.5kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 45 minutes. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 7% to 73%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 146 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 8 hours and 10 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you park side into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
### Battery swap

This model support battery swap. Battery swap means you can drive to a unique battery swap station and get the battery replaced with a new battery with 90% SOC. The battery swap takes 7 minutes.
