## Performance

The Nio EL7 has a maximum power of 480KW (653hp). The total torque is 850nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 3,9 seconds. The top speed is 200 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

Nio EL7 has two battery options with different specifications. Below you see how this affects range and charging. 
### 100kWh

The battery has a gross capacity of 100kWh and a net capacity of 90kWh, meaning you have a 10kWh buffer for protection. (10,0%). The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 513 to 486 km (319-302 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 17,5kWh/100km for the basic version and 18,5kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 126kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 75 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 41 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 44% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 86kW. Each charge session would take 27 minutes and 2 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 28kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 34 minutes to drive. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 1% to 54%. The total time lost for charging will be 134 minutes.   
### 75kWh

The battery has a gross capacity of 75kWh and a net capacity of 70,5kWh, meaning you have a 4,5kWh buffer for protection. (6,0%). The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 394 to 372 km (245-231 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 17,5kWh/100km for the basic version and 18,5kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 140kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 65 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 34 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 7% to 74% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 77kW. Each charge session would take 37 minutes and 57 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 28kWh/100km, 1000km will take 11 hours and 6 minutes to drive. This trip will require five charge session(s) charging from 8% to 68%. The total time lost for charging will be 166 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 8 hours and 10 minutes. 
### Battery swap

This model support battery swap. Battery swap means you can drive to a unique battery swap station and get the battery replaced with a new battery with 90% SOC. The battery swap takes 7 minutes.
