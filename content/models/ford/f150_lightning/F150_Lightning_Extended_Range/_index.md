## Performance

The Ford F150 Lightning Extended Range has a maximum power of 433KW (589hp). The total torque is 1050nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes  seconds. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 150kWh and a net capacity of 131kWh, meaning you have a 19kWh buffer for protection. (12,7%). The battery is a Lithium-Ion battery based on [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc) For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 155kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 130 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 49 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 0% to 62% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 106kW. Each charge session would take 46 minutes and 54 seconds. 
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 19,2KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 49 minutes.
