## Performance

The Ford F150 Lightning Extended Range has a maximum power of 433KW (589hp). The total torque is 1050nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 4,2 seconds. The top speed is 180 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 150kWh and a net capacity of 131kWh, meaning you have a 19kWh buffer for protection. (12,7%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc) 

The [EPA range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa) varies from 320 to 300 miles (515-483 km), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 2,44mi/kWh for the basic version and 2,29mi/kWh for the top trim version for the EPA standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 155kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 130 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 49 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 0% to 62% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 106kW. Each charge session would take 46 minutes and 54 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 33kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 13 minutes to drive. This trip will require two charge session(s) charging from 0% to 76%. The total time lost for charging will be 113 minutes.   

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 19,2KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 49 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger.  The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Ford F150 Lightning Extended Range has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. 

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 226 mm. 

### Brakes



[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in several modes. The most efficient is [automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive). In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking to reduce speed. You can also enable [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). 

## Exterior

You can choose between 6 different paint colors when ordering this model. 
Additionally, you can choose between 3 wheels with sizes from 18 to 22 inches. 

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [tailgate](../../../../technology/doors/#split-tailgate) where the gate falls down. 

There is only one roof for this model. As an option, you can order this model with a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the carâ€™s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

## Advanced driver assistance systems

The Ford F150 Lightning Extended Range has several standard and optional [advanced driver assistance systems](../../../../technology/driverassistance/)  (ADAS) for better safety and comfort.
### Safety systems



The Ford F150 Lightning Extended Range has an [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The Ford F150 Lightning Extended Range has a [**lane-keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has a [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Forward Collision Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/) is a standard driver assist system to help drivers avoid or mitigate frontal collisions. 

The Ford F150 Lightning Extended Range has an [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/)  as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.

[**Automatic emergency steering**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencysteering/) is a optional  driver assist system designed to help drivers avoid collisions by automatically steering the vehicle in an emergency. 

[**Blind-spot monitoring**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/blindspotmonitoring/) is a optional driver-assist system. This side assist system helps to detect traffic in blind spots. 

### Driving Automation

The Ford F150 Lightning Extended Range offers [driving automation on level 1 or 2](../../../../technology/driverassistance/#level-of-autonomous-driving), depending on the equipment level.

With the Ford Co-Pilot360â„¢ 2.0  level 1 system, you get the following driving automation features. 
- Cruise control. 


With the Ford Co-Pilot360â„¢ Assist 2.0  level 2 system, you get additional driving automation features to the ones listed above. 
- [**Adaptive Cruise control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/adaptivecruisecontrol/) 
- [**Automatic parking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticparking/).  


With the Ford Co-Pilot360â„¢ Active 2.0  level 2 system, you get additional driving automation features to the ones listed above. 
- [**Autosteer**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/autosteer/): keeps the car in your lane and slows down if needed in traffic. The system limits how long you can drive without touching the steering wheel. 
- [**Automatic lane change**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automatedlanechange/)
