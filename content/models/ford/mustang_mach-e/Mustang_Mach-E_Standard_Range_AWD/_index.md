## Performance

The Ford Mustang Mach-E Standard Range AWD delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 258 kW (351 hp / 346 bhp) and a total torque of 580 Nm (428 ft-lb). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.8 seconds and reaches a top speed of 180 km/h (112 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The electric vehicle features a high-capacity battery with a gross capacity of 75,7 kWh and a net usable capacity of 70 kWh, providing an 5,7 kWh buffer (3.6%) for battery protection. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) is 400 km (249 mi). The consumption is 17.5kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 150 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 117 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 34 minutes with an average charging speed at 86 kW. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 4% to 46%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 80kW. Each charge session would take 22 minutes and 3 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 24kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 29 minutes. This trip will require six charge session(s) charging from 5% to 46%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 129 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 21 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
