## Performance

The Ford Mustanc Mach-E Long Range AWD has a maximum power of 258KW (351hp). The total torque is 580nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 5,8 seconds. The top speed is 180 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 98,7kWh and a net capacity of 92kWh, meaning you have a 6,7kWh buffer for protection. (6,8%).  The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 550 km (342 mi).   The consumption is 16,7kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 150kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 154 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 45 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 5% to 45% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 85kW. Each charge session would take 26 minutes and 4 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 22kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 51 minutes to drive. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 6% to 41%. The total time lost for charging will be 92 minutes.
