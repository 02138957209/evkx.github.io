## Performance

The Ford Mustang Mach-E Standard Range RWD has a maximum power of 258 KW (351 hp/346 bhp). The total torque is 580 nm (428 ft-lb). It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 5,8 seconds. The top speed is 180 km/h.

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 75,7kWh and a net capacity of 70kWh, meaning you have a 5,7kWh buffer for protection. (7,5%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) is 440 km (274 mi). The consumption is 15.9kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 150kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 117 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 34 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 4% to 46%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 80kW. Each charge session would take 22 minutes and 3 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 22kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 12 minutes. This trip will require five charge session(s) charging from 4% to 47%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 113 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 21 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
