## Performance

The Mercedes-Maybach EQS 680 SUV has a maximum power of 484KW (658hp). The total torque is 950nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 4,4 seconds. The top speed is 210 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 120kWh and a net capacity of 108,4kWh, meaning you have a 11,6kWh buffer for protection. (9,7%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc) 

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 600 to 502 km (373-312 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 18,1kWh/100km for the basic version and 21,6kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 200kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 82 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 30 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 57% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 142kW. Each charge session would take 26 minutes and 41 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 28,5kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 35 minutes to drive. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 1% to 56%. The total time lost for charging will be 76 minutes.   

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 9 hours and 51 minutes. 

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This makes it easy for charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Mercedes-Maybach EQS 680 SUV has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motor(s) used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/). 

The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 181 mm, and the max is 206 mm. 

### Steering

Dynamic steering is standard on the Mercedes-Maybach EQS 680 SUV. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is standard. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.  

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 415mm, and the rear discs are 378mm. 

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in several modes. The most efficient is [automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive). In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking to reduce speed. You can also enable [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). 

## Exterior

You can choose between 9 different paint colors when ordering this model. 

You can also choose several styling options to make your car more unique. 
exterior.styling.night

 In addition, you can equip this model with an AMG line exterior package. This package gives a more sporty design with a sporty diffusor and a new twin blade grill. 

Additionally, you can choose between 4 wheels with sizes from 21 to 22 inches. 

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). 

You can choose between two types of roofs on this model. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a panoramic roof. The glass has two panels. One over the first and the second rows, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the carâ€™s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. Both glass panels have an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.
