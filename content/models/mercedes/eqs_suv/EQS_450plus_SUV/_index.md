## Performance

The Mercedes-EQ EQS 450+ SUV has a maximum power of 265KW (360hp). The total torque is 568nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 6,7 seconds. The top speed is 210 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 120kWh and a net capacity of 108,4kWh, meaning you have a 11,6kWh buffer for protection. (9,7%). Depending on car options, the [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 672 to 540 km (418-336 mi). Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 16,1kWh/100km for the basic version and 20,1kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range see real world data and our full range listing in our [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page for this model. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 200kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 82 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 30 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 57% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 142kW. Each charge session would take 26 minutes and 41 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 25kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 21 minutes to drive. This trip will require two charge session(s) charging from 1% to 67%. The total time lost for charging will be 61 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 9 hours and 51 minutes. 

## Drivetrain

Mercedes-EQ EQS 450+ SUV has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors. One on each axle. 

The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. Minimum ground clearance is 181 mm and max 206 mm. 

### Steering

Dynamic steering is standard on Mercedes-EQ EQS 450+ SUV. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is standard. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.  

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are cast-iron discs. The front discs are 415mm, and the rear discs are 378mm.
