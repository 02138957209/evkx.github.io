## Performance

The Mercedes-AMG EQS 53 4MATIC+ has a maximum power of 484KW (658hp). The total torque is 858nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 3,8 seconds. The top speed is 220 kph. 

If you are not happy enough with the standard performance, you can add the AMG Dynamic Plus performance option. Then the numbers are improved. The Mercedes-AMG EQS 53 4MATIC+ has a maximum power of 560KW (761hp). The total torque is 1020nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 3,4 seconds. The top speed is 250 kph. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 120kWh and a net capacity of 107,8kWh, meaning you have 12,2kWh reserved as a buffer for protection. (10,2%). The range varies based on the equipment trim. Based on the WLTP standard test, the range varies from 570km to 513km, depending on the equipment. The consumption is between 18,9kWh/100km for the basic version and 21,0kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 210kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 82 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 30 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 57% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 142kW. Each charge session would take 26 minutes and 34 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 25,2kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 21 minutes to drive. This will requires two charge sessions charging from 1% to 68%. The total time lost for charging will be 62 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 22KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 4 hours and 53 minutes.
