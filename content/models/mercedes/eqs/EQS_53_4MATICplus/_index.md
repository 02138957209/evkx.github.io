## Performance

The Mercedes-AMG EQS 53 4MATIC+ has a maximum power of 484KW (658hp). The total torque is 858nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 3,8 seconds. The top speed is 220 km/h. 

If you are not happy enough with the standard performance, you can add the AMG Dynamic Plus performance option. Then the numbers are improved. The Mercedes-AMG EQS 53 4MATIC+ has a maximum power of 560KW (761hp). The total torque is 1020nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 3,4 seconds. The top speed is 250 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 120kWh and a net capacity of 107,8kWh, meaning you have a 12,2kWh buffer for protection. (10,2%). The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 570 to 513 km (354-319 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 18,9kWh/100km for the basic version and 21,0kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 210kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 82 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 30 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 57% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 142kW. Each charge session would take 26 minutes and 34 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 25,2kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 21 minutes to drive. This trip will require two charge session(s) charging from 1% to 68%. The total time lost for charging will be 62 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 22KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 4 hours and 53 minutes.

## Drivetrain

Mercedes-AMG EQS 53 4MATIC+ has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motor(s) used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/). 

The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 82 mm, and the max is 127 mm. 

### Steering

Dynamic steering is standard on the Mercedes-AMG EQS 53 4MATIC+. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is standard. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.  

### Brakes

You can choose between different brake systems. The standard option brakes use regular [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 415mm, and the rear discs are 378mm. The second option brakes uses [ceramic discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#ceramic-brakes). The front discs are 440mm, and the rear discs are 378mm. 

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in several modes. The most efficient is [automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive). In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking to reduce speed. You can also enable [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). 

## Exterior

You can choose between 11 different paint colors when ordering this model. 
The optional AMG Night Package finishes selected exterior elements in high-gloss black. Depending on the chosen paint color â€“ this results in either strong contrasts or flowing transitions. 

Additionally, you can choose between 4 wheels with sizes from 21 to 22 inches. 

The car has four regular doors and a tailgate. The tailgate is electric-powered and has a kick-sensor as standard. 

You can choose between two types of roofs on this model. The standard is just a regular roof. The optional has a panoramic roof. You can open the panoramic roof and have the possibility to block the light with a curtain.
