## Performance

The Mercedes-EQ EQS 580 4MATIC has a maximum power of 385KW (523hp). The total torque is 858nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 4,3 seconds. The top speed is 210 kph. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 120kWh and a net capacity of 108,4kWh, meaning you have a 11,6kWh buffer for protection. (9,7%). The range varies based on the equipment trim. Based on the WLTP standard test, the range varies from 692km to 583km, depending on the equipment. The consumption is between 15,7kWh/100km for the basic version and 18,6kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 210kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 82 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 30 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 57% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 142kW. Each charge session would take 26 minutes and 41 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 22kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 7 minutes to drive. This will requires two charge sessions charging from 1% to 53%. The total time lost for charging will be 48 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 22KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 4 hours and 55 minutes.
