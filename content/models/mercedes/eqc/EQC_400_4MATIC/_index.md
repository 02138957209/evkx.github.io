## Performance

The Mercedes-EQ EQC 400 4MATIC has a maximum power of 300KW (408hp). The total torque is 760nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 5,1 seconds. The top speed is 180 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 86kWh and a net capacity of 80kWh, meaning you have a 6kWh buffer for protection. (7,0%). Depending on car options, the [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 432 to 400 km (268-249 mi). Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 18,5kWh/100km for the basic version and 20,0kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 112kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 67 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 37 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 8% to 67% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 82kW. Each charge session would take 35 minutes and 30 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 25kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 26 minutes to drive. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 8% to 62%. The total time lost for charging will be 127 minutes.   
### Onboard charger
