## Performance

The Mercedes-EQ EQC 400 4MATIC has a maximum power of 300 KW (408 hp/402 bhp). The total torque is 760 nm (561 ft-lb). It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 5.1 seconds. The top speed is 180 km/h.

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 86kWh and a net capacity of 80kWh, meaning you have a 6kWh buffer for protection. (7.0%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) varies from 432 to 400 km (269-249 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range. The consumption is between 18.5kWh/100km for the basic version and 20.0kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 112kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 67 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 37 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 8% to 67%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 82kW. Each charge session would take 35 minutes and 30 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 25kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 26 minutes. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 8% to 62%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 127 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 16 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Mercedes-EQ EQC 400 4MATIC has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motor(s) used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/).

The Adaptive Air Suspension suspension has steel springs with a fixed height, but you can adjust damping to fit your driving style or road condition. The ground clearance with this suspension is 97 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Mercedes-EQ EQC 400 4MATIC. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes).

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in several modes. The most efficient is [automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive). In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking to reduce speed. You can also enable [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). At low speeds, the one-pedal drive mode will keep the car rolling until it stops by itself.

## Exterior

You can choose between 11 different paint colors when ordering this model.
 In addition, you can equip this model with an AMG line exterior package. This package gives a more sporty design with a sporty diffusor and a new twin blade grill. 


Additionally, you can choose between 10 wheels with sizes from 19 to 21 inches.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate).

There is only one roof for this model. As an option, you can order this model with a sunroof. The glass extends over only the front row, and occupants can open it. This glass makes the carâ€™s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.
