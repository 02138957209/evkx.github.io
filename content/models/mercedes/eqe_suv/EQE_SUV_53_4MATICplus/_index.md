## Performance

The Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 53 4MATIC+ has a maximum power of 460KW (625hp). The total torque is 950nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 3,7 seconds. The top speed is 220 km/h. 

If you are not happy enough with the standard performance, you can add the AMG Dynamic Plus performance option. Then the numbers are improved. The Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 53 4MATIC+ has a maximum power of 505KW (687hp). The total torque is 1000nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 3,5 seconds. The top speed is 240 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 95,8kWh and a net capacity of 90,6kWh, meaning you have a 5,2kWh buffer for protection. (5,4%). Depending on car options, the [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 470 to 375 km (292-233 mi). Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 19,3kWh/100km for the basic version and 24,2kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 170kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 55 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 29 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 2% to 64% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 121kW. Each charge session would take 28 minutes and 48 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 27kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 50 minutes to drive. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 2% to 69%. The total time lost for charging will be 90 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the standard onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 8 hours and 14 minutes. You can also select an optional onboard charger that supports up to 22KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 4 hours and 7 minutes.
