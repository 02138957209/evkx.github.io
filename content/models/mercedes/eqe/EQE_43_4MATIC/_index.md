## Performance

The Mercedes-AMG EQE 43 4MATIC delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 350 kW (476 hp / 469 bhp) and a total torque of 858 Nm (633 lb-ft). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 4.2 seconds and reaches a top speed of 210 km/h (131 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 96,12 kWh and a net usable capacity of 90,6 kWh, providing an 5,52 kWh buffer (5.7%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 328 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 533 to 462 km (331-287 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels, for instance, can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 17.0 kWh/100 km for the base model and 19.6 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 170 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 55 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 29 minutes with an average charging speed at 132 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 2% to 64%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 121 kW, with each charging session taking about 28 minutes and 48 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 25.2 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 40 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 2% to 62%, with a total charging time of 81 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 22 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 4 hours and 7 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

Mercedes-AMG EQE 43 4MATIC features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 82 mm, and the maximum is 127 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Mercedes-AMG EQE 43 4MATIC. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as a standard feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes

You can choose between different brake systems. The standard option brakes use regular [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The second option brakes uses [ceramic discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#ceramic-brakes).

### Regenerative braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**. You can choose between two stopping modes for one-pedal driving. **Hold mode** brings the vehicle to a complete stop using friction brakes, and **Roll mode** allows the vehicle to roll until it stops naturally.

## Exterior

The Mercedes-AMG EQE 43 4MATIC, with dimensions of 4964 mm in length, 1961 mm in width, and 1492 mm in height, falls into E-segment cars, also known as executive cars, are larger and more luxurious than their D-segment counterparts. They are designed to offer superior comfort, advanced technology, and high performance, making them suitable for a specific set of drivers. The Mercedes-AMG EQE 43 4MATIC offers a selection of 11 paint colors, featuring solid, metallic, and matte options. Alongside the standard palette, exclusive colors are available from the 'MANUFAKTUR' palette.

You can also choose several styling options to make your car more unique.
 In addition, you can equip this model with an AMG line exterior package. This package gives a more sporty design with a sporty diffusor and a new twin blade grill. 


The optional AMG Night Package finishes selected exterior elements in high-gloss black. Depending on the chosen paint color – this results in either strong contrasts or flowing transitions. 



You can select from multiple wheel options in different sizes on the Mercedes-AMG EQE 43 4MATIC, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 265/40 tires on 20" rims front and 295/35 tires on 20" rims rear
- 265/35 tires on 21" rims front and 295/30 tires on 21" rims rear

More narrow wheels will improve consumption and give a longer range, while wider wheels will provide better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [boot lid](../../../../technology/doors/#boot-lid) for the trunk.

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a panoramic roof. The glass has two panels. One over the first and the second rows, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. Both glass panels have an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.
