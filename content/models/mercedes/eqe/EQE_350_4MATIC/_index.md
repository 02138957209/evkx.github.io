## Performance

The Mercedes-EQ EQE 350 4MATIC has a maximum power of 215KW (292hp). The total torque is 565nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 6,3 seconds. The top speed is 210 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 96,12kWh and a net capacity of 90,6kWh, meaning you have a 5,52kWh buffer for protection. (5,7%). The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 597 to 507 km (371-315 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 15,2kWh/100km for the basic version and 17,9kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 170kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 55 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 29 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 2% to 64% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 121kW. Each charge session would take 28 minutes and 48 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 21,0kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 19 minutes to drive. This trip will require two charge session(s) charging from 2% to 68%. The total time lost for charging will be 59 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 22KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 4 hours and 7 minutes.

## Drivetrain

Mercedes-EQ EQE 350 4MATIC has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/) at front axle and [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/) at rear axle. 

The standard suspension has steel springs with a fixed height but an optional damping adjustment. The ground clearance with this suspension is 107 mm. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 82 mm, and the max is 127 mm. 

### Steering

Dynamic steering is standard on the Mercedes-EQ EQE 350 4MATIC. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is standard. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.  

### Brakes

You can choose between different brake systems. The standard option brakes use regular [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The second option brakes uses [ceramic discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#ceramic-brakes). 

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in several modes. The most efficient is [automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive). In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking to reduce speed. You can also enable [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). 

## Exterior

You can choose between 11 different paint colors when ordering this model. 

You can also choose several styling options to make your car more unique. 
 In addition, you can equip this model with an AMG line exterior package. This package gives a more sporty design with a sporty diffusor and a new twin blade grill. 

The optional AMG Night Package finishes selected exterior elements in high-gloss black. Depending on the chosen paint color â€“ this results in either strong contrasts or flowing transitions. 

Additionally, you can choose between 13 wheels with sizes from 19 to 21 inches. 

The car has four regular doors and a boot lid for the trunk. 

You can choose between two types of roofs on this model. The standard is just a regular roof. The optional has a panoramic roof. You can open the panoramic roof and have the possibility to block the light with a curtain.
