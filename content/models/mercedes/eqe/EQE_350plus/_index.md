## Performance

The Mercedes-EQ EQE 350+ offers modest performance with a maximum power of 215 kW (292 hp / 288 bhp) and a total torque of 565 Nm (417 ft-lb). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 6.4 seconds and has a top speed of 210 km/h (131 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 96,12kWh and a net capacity of 90,6kWh, meaning you have a 5,52kWh buffer for protection. (5.7%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) varies from 639 to 550 km (397-342 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range. The consumption is between 14.2kWh/100km for the basic version and 16.5kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 170kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 55 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 29 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 2% to 64%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 121kW. Each charge session would take 28 minutes and 48 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 21.0kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 19 minutes. This trip will require two charge session(s) charging from 2% to 68%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 59 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 22 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 4 hours and 7 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Mercedes-EQ EQE 350+ has a rear-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the rear axle. The motor(s) used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

The standard suspension has steel springs with a fixed height but an optional damping adjustment. The ground clearance with this suspension is 107 mm. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 82 mm, and the maximum is 127 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Mercedes-EQ EQE 350+. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as a standard feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes

You can choose between different brake systems. The standard option brakes use regular [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The second option brakes uses [ceramic discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#ceramic-brakes).

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in several modes. The most efficient is [automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive). In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking to reduce speed. You can also enable [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). You can choose between two stopping modes for one-pedal driving. Hold mode stops the car completely using friction brakes, and roll mode causes the vehicle to roll until it stops by itself.

## Exterior

You can choose between 11 different paint colors when ordering this model.

You can also choose several styling options to make your car more unique.
 In addition, you can equip this model with an AMG line exterior package. This package gives a more sporty design with a sporty diffusor and a new twin blade grill. 


The optional AMG Night Package finishes selected exterior elements in high-gloss black. Depending on the chosen paint color – this results in either strong contrasts or flowing transitions. 


Additionally, you can choose between 13 wheels with sizes from 19 to 21 inches.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [boot lid](../../../../technology/doors/#boot-lid) for the trunk.

You can choose between two types of roofs on this model. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a panoramic roof. The glass has two panels. One over the first and the second rows, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. Both glass panels have an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.
