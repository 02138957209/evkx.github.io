## Performance

The Mercedes-EQ EQA 250 has a maximum power of 168KW (228hp). The total torque is 390nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 7,7 seconds. The top speed is 160 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 69,7kWh and a net capacity of 66,5kWh, meaning you have a 3,2kWh buffer for protection. (4,6%). 

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 438 to 411 km (272-255 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 15,2kWh/100km for the basic version and 16,2kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 112kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 59 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 29 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 4% to 70% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 84kW. Each charge session would take 31 minutes and 19 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 22kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 10 minutes to drive. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 4% to 62%. The total time lost for charging will be 111 minutes.   

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 2 minutes. 

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This makes it easy for charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Mercedes-EQ EQA 250 has a front-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the front axle. The motor(s) used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/). 



### Steering

Dynamic steering is standard on the Mercedes-EQ EQA 250. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. 

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). 

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in several modes. The most efficient is [automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive). In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking to reduce speed. You can also enable [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). At low speeds, the one-pedal drive mode will keep the car rolling until it stops by itself. 

## Exterior

You can choose between 10 different paint colors when ordering this model. 
 In addition, you can equip this model with an AMG line exterior package. This package gives a more sporty design with a sporty diffusor and a new twin blade grill. 

Additionally, you can choose between 6 wheels with sizes from 18 to 19 inches. 

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). 

You can choose between two types of roofs on this model. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a panoramic roof. The glass has two panels. One over the first and the second rows, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the carâ€™s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. Both glass panels have an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.
