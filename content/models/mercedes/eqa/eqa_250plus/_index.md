## Performance

The Mercedes-EQ EQA 250+ offers modest performance with a maximum power of 140 kW (190 hp / 188 bhp) and a total torque of 385 Nm (284 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 8.6 seconds and has a top speed of 160 km/h (99 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 73,9 kWh and a net usable capacity of 70,5 kWh, providing an 3,4 kWh buffer (4.6%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 367 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 560 to 497 km (348-309 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels, for instance, can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 12.6 kWh/100 km for the base model and 14.2 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 112 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 63 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 36 minutes with an average charging speed at 82 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 4% to 66%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 77 kW, with each charging session taking about 34 minutes and 56 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 22 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 18 minutes. This journey would require four charging stops from 4% to 58%, with a total charging time of 119 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 6 hours and 24 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

Mercedes-EQ EQA 250+ has a front-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the front axle. The motor used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/).

### Suspension


### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Mercedes-EQ EQA 250+. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes).

### Regenerative braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**. However, it is not considered full one-pedal driving since, at low speeds, the vehicle will keep rolling until it comes to a stop by itself.

## Exterior

The Mercedes-EQ EQA 250+, with dimensions of 4463 mm in length, 1834 mm in width, and 1624 mm in height, falls into the B-SUV segment cars, also known as subcompact SUVs or crossovers, offer a combination of the compact size and maneuverability of B-segment cars with the higher driving position, increased cargo space, and rugged styling of an SUV. The Mercedes-EQ EQA 250+ offers a selection of 10 paint colors, featuring solid, metallic, and matte options. Alongside the standard palette, exclusive colors are available from the 'MANUFAKTUR' palette.
 In addition, you can equip this model with an AMG line exterior package. This package gives a more sporty design with a sporty diffusor and a new twin blade grill. 



You can select from multiple wheel options in different sizes on the Mercedes-EQ EQA 250+, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 235/55 tires on 18" rims
- 235/50 tires on 19" rims

More narrow wheels will improve consumption and give a longer range, while wider wheels will provide better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate).

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a panoramic roof. The glass has two panels. One over the first and the second rows, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. Both glass panels have an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.
