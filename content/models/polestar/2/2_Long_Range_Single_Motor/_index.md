## Performance

The Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor has a maximum power of 220KW (299hp). The total torque is 490nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 6,2 seconds. The top speed is 205 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 82kWh and a net capacity of 79kWh, meaning you have a 3kWh buffer for protection. (3,7%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc) 

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 635 to 591 km (395-367 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 12,4kWh/100km for the basic version and 13,4kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 205kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 65 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 28 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 50%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss on 120kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 24 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 21,5kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 29 minutes to drive. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 1% to 59%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 70 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 10 minutes. 

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor has a rear-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the rear axle. 

The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 151 mm. 

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). 

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in two modes. You can use [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) or you can coast and use the [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal) to regen. You can choose between two stopping modes for one-pedal driving. Hold mode stops the car completely using friction brakes and creep mode will creep the car forward at low speed. You can adjust how strong regen you get when you lift the foot. There are two levels.

## Exterior

You can choose between 6 different paint colors when ordering this model. 
Additionally, you can choose between 3 wheels with sizes from 19 to 20 inches.
