## Performance

The Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor has a maximum power of 310KW (421hp). The total torque is 740nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 4,5 seconds. The top speed is 205 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 82kWh and a net capacity of 79kWh, meaning you have a 3kWh buffer for protection. (3,7%). The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 592 to 551 km (368-342 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 13,3kWh/100km for the basic version and 14,3kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 205kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 102 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 38 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 5% to 51% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 94kW. Each charge session would take 23 minutes and 11 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 28kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 28 minutes to drive. This trip will require five charge session(s) charging from 4% to 55%. The total time lost for charging will be 129 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 10 minutes.

## Advanced driver assistance systems

The Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor has several standard and optional [advanced driver assistance systems](../../../../technology/driverassistance/)  (ADAS) for better safety and comfort.

[**Efficiency assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/efficencyassist/) is a standard system that helps the driver to drive preemptively and save energy. 
### Safety systems



The Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor has a [**Electronic Stability Control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/electronicstabilitycontrol/)  as a standard system that is designed to improve the stability and handling of a vehicle during sudden maneuvers or slippery road conditions.

The Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor has a [**lane keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Rear Cross Traffic Alert**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/rearcrosstrafficalert/) is a standard driver assist system that uses sensors to detect approaching vehicles from the side when backing out of a parking space or driveway.
