## Performance

The Polestar 3 Long Range Dual Motor Performance has a maximum power of 380KW (517hp). The total torque is 910nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 4,7 seconds. The top speed is 210 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 111kWh and a net capacity of 107kWh, meaning you have a 4kWh buffer for protection. (3,6%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc) 

 The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 560 km (348 mi).   The consumption is 19,1kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 250kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 68 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 32 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 4% to 54% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 136kW. Each charge session would take 24 minutes and 31 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 28kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 36 minutes to drive. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 3% to 57%. The total time lost for charging will be 76 minutes.   

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 9 hours and 43 minutes. 

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This makes it easy for charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Polestar 3 Long Range Dual Motor Performance has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. 

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 181 mm, and the max is 241 mm. 

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 400mm, and the rear discs are 390mm. 

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in two modes. You can use [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) or you can coast and use the [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal) to regen. You can choose between two stopping modes for one-pedal driving. Hold mode stops the car completely using friction brakes and creep mode will creep the car forward at low speed. You can adjust how strong regen you get when you lift the foot. There are two levels.

## Exterior

You can choose between 6 different paint colors when ordering this model. 

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [hatchback-style liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#hatcback-style-liftgate). 

You can choose between two types of roofs on this model. As an option, you can order this model with a large panoramic roof extending from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car's interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.
