We have separated our Rolls-Royce Spectre article into sections. If you want to wait to read the full article, click the links below to the different areas. We also have an overview of the [full specifications](specifications/), an [image gallery](gallery/), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve/), and some [online reviews](reviews/).

## Performance

The Rolls-Royce Spectre has a maximum power of 430 KW (585 hp/577 bhp) and a total torque of 900 nm (664 ft-lb). It can sprint from 0 to 100km/h (0 to 62mph) in 4.5 seconds and has a top speed of 250 km/h (155.4 mph).

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 105,7kWh and a net capacity of 102kWh, meaning you have a 3,7kWh buffer for protection. (3.5%).

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) is 530 km (329 mi). The consumption is 19.2kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 205kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 72 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 36 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 0% to 45%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 132kW. Each charge session would take 21 minutes and 54 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 26kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 33 minutes. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 1% to 40%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 73 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 9 hours and 16 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Rolls-Royce Spectre has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motor(s) used are [Wound-Rotor Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/wrsm/).

The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 193 mm, and the maximum is 223 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Rolls-Royce Spectre. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as a standard feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes



[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in two modes. You can use [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) or you can coast and use the [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal) to regen. The system stops the car completely using friction brakes.

## Exterior

You can choose between 8 different paint colors when ordering this model.

The car has two [suicide doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [bootlid](../../../../technology/doors/#bootlid) in the rear. Soft close is a standard function for the side doors. Powered doors are a standard function for the side doors.

There is only one roof for this model. The standard is just a regular roof.

You can order the car with tinted windows from B-pillar and back.

## Advanced driver assistance systems

The Rolls-Royce Spectre has several standard and optional [advanced driver assistance systems](../../../../technology/driverassistance/)  (ADAS) for better safety and comfort.
### Safety systems



The Rolls-Royce Spectre has an [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The Rolls-Royce Spectre has an [**Electronic Stability Control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/electronicstabilitycontrol/)  as a standard system designed to improve a vehicle's stability and handling during sudden maneuvers or slippery road conditions.

The Rolls-Royce Spectre has a [**lane-keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has a [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Rear Cross Traffic Alert**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/rearcrosstrafficalert/) is an optional driver assist system that uses sensors to detect approaching vehicles from the side when backing out of a parking space or driveway.

[**Forward Collision Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/) is an optional driver assist system to help drivers avoid or mitigate frontal collisions.

The Rolls-Royce Spectre has [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/) as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.

[**Automatic emergency steering**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencysteering/) is an optional  driver assist system designed to help drivers avoid collisions by automatically steering the vehicle in an emergency.

### Driving Automation



With the Driving Assistant Professional  level 2 system, you get the following driving automation features.
- [**Adaptive Cruise control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/adaptivecruisecontrol/)
- [**Lane Centering Assist (LCA) /AutoSteer**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/autosteer/): keeps the car in your lane and slows down if needed in traffic. The system limits how long you can drive without touching the steering wheel.
- [**Automatic parking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticparking/). (optional)
