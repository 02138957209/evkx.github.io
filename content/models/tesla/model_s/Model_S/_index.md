## Performance

The Tesla Model S has a maximum power of 493KW (670hp). The total torque is 800nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 3,2 seconds. The top speed is 250 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 100kWh and a net capacity of 96kWh, meaning you have a 4kWh buffer for protection. (4,0%). 

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 649 to 634 km (403-394 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 14,8kWh/100km for the basic version and 15,1kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 250kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 80 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 31 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 7% to 47% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 143kW. Each charge session would take 16 minutes and 9 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 19,7kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 3 minutes to drive. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 8% to 44%. The total time lost for charging will be 44 minutes.   

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 8 hours and 43 minutes. 

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear corner](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-corner). This makes it easy for charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**NACS**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#nacs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available through [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) or coasting is not available in this model. You can choose between three stopping modes for one-pedal driving. Hold mode stops the car completely using friction brakes, roll mode causes the vehicle to roll until it stops by itself, and creep mode will creep the car forward at low speed. You can adjust how strong regen you get when you lift the foot. There are two levels.

## Exterior

You can choose between 5 different paint colors when ordering this model. 
Additionally, you can choose between 2 wheels with sizes from 19 to 21 inches. 

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). 

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof has a large panoramic roof extending from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car's interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted.
