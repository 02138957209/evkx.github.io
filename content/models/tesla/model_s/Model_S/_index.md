## Performance

The Tesla Model S packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 493 kW (670 hp / 661 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 800 Nm (590 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 3.2 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 104,96 kWh and a net usable capacity of 96 kWh, providing an 8,96 kWh buffer (8.5%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 407 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 649 to 634 km (403-394 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels, for instance, can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 14.8 kWh/100 km for the base model and 15.1 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 250 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 80 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 31 minutes with an average charging speed at 132 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 7% to 47%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 143 kW, with each charging session taking about 16 minutes and 9 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 19.7 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 3 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 8% to 44%, with a total charging time of 44 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 8 hours and 43 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The charge port is conveniently located at the [left rear corner](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-corner) of the vehicle, facilitating easy access when backing into charging stations. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**NACS**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#nacs) for North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
