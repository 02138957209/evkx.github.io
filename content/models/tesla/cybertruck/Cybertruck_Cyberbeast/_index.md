## Performance

The Tesla Cybertruck Cyberbeast delivers a jaw-dropping maximum power of 630 KW (857 hp/845 bhp) and a massive total torque of 930 Nm (686 lb-ft). This powerhouse can rocket from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 2.7 seconds, showcasing its astonishing acceleration. Additionally, it achieves a top speed of 209 km/h (130 mph), making it a true marvel of engineering and performance.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 123 kWh and a net usable capacity of 122,5 kWh, providing an 0,5 kWh buffer (0.4%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 710 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities.

According to the [EPA](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) (Environmental Protection Agency) standard, the vehicle has an range of 320 miles (515 km) with an energy consumption rate of 2.6 miles per kWh. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 250 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 77 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 41 minutes with an average charging speed at 124 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 0% to 37%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 157 kW, with each charging session taking about 17 minutes and 22 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 30.0 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 29 minutes. This journey would require four charging stops from 0% to 37%, with a total charging time of 69 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 11 hours and 8 minutes using a home charging setup.

{{< sitefiguresized thumb="models/tesla/cybertruck/cybertruck_cyberbeast/charging_1_st.jpg" title="Tesla Cybertruck Cyberbeast" width="3000" height="2250"  >}}

### Charge port

The charge port is conveniently located at the [left rear corner](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-corner) of the vehicle, facilitating easy access when backing into charging stations. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**NACS**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#nacs) for North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

Tesla Cybertruck Cyberbeast has an all-wheel drive system supported by three motors. One on front axle, and two on rear axle. The motors used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/) at the front axle and [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/) at the rear axle.

### Suspension

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 138 mm, and the maximum is 442 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Tesla Cybertruck Cyberbeast. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as a standard feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 355mm, and the rear discs are 355mm.

### Regenerative braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) in this model is primarily facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). Unlike some models, [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) or coasting is not available here. This model offers three stopping modes for one-pedal driving: <ul><li>**Hold mode** brings the vehicle to a complete stop using friction brakes</li><li>**Roll mode** allows the vehicle to roll until it stops naturally</li><li>**Creep mode** moves the car forward at low speed</li></ul>

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are two levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

## Exterior

The Tesla Cybertruck Cyberbeast is available in a total of 3 solid paint colors.

You can select from multiple wheel designs, all available in the same size, on the Tesla Cybertruck Cyberbeast, allowing you to personalize your vehicle to match your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 285/65 tires on 20" rims

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [tailgate](../../../../technology/doors/#split-tailgate) where the gate falls down. The tailgate is electrically powered.

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof includes a large panoramic glass roof extending from the front to the rear, enhancing the interior's spacious and bright feel, thereby improving the mood and comfort of occupants. This glass is tinted to protect against heat from the sun.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
