## Performance

The Tesla Cybertruck Cyberbeast has a maximum power of 630KW (857hp). The total torque is 13959nm. It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 2,7 seconds. The top speed is 210 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 130kWh and a net capacity of 123kWh, meaning you have a 7kWh buffer for protection. (5,4%). 

 The [EPA range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) is 320 miles (515 km).   The consumption is 2.6mi/kWh for the EPA standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 250kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 102 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 39 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 8% to 45%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 154kW. Each charge session would take 18 minutes and 47 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 28,5kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 23 minutes. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 8% to 41%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 64 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 11 hours and 10 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear corner](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-corner). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**NACS**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#nacs) for North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for Europe. See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Tesla Cybertruck Cyberbeast has an all-wheel drive system supported by three motors. One on front axle, and two on rear axle. The motors used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/) at the front axle and [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/) at the rear axle. 

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 138 mm, and the maximum is 442 mm. 

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Tesla Cybertruck Cyberbeast. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as a standard feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.  

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 355mm, and the rear discs are 355mm. 

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available through [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) or coasting is not available in this model. You can choose between three stopping modes for one-pedal driving. Hold mode stops the car completely using friction brakes, roll mode causes the vehicle to roll until it stops by itself, and creep mode will creep the car forward at low speed. You can adjust how strong regen you get when you lift the foot. There are two levels.

## Exterior

You can choose between 3 different paint colors when ordering this model. 

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [tailgate](../../../../technology/doors/#split-tailgate) where the gate falls down. The tailgate is electric powered. 

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof has a large panoramic roof extending from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car's interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted.
