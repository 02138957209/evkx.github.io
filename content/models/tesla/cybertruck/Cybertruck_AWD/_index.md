## Performance

The Tesla Cybertruck AWD packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 448 kW (609 hp / 601 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 671 Nm (495 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 4.1 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 180 km/h (112 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 123 kWh and a net usable capacity of 122,5 kWh, providing an 0,5 kWh buffer (0.4%) for battery protection.

The [EPA range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) is 340 miles (547 km). The consumption is 2.8mi/kWh for the EPA standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 250 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 77 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 41 minutes with an average charging speed at 124 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 0% to 37%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 157 kW, with each charging session taking about 17 minutes and 22 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 32 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 37 minutes. This journey would require four charging stops from 0% to 41%, with a total charging time of 77 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 11 hours and 8 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear corner](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-corner). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**NACS**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#nacs) for North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for Europe. See full specifications for all markets.

### V2L - Vehichle to load

This model supports V2L (Vehicle 2 Load), which means you can power electrical equipment requiring up to 11.5 kW power, including charging other vehicles. There are sockets available both on the cargo bed and in the cabin.
