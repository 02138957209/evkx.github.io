## Performance

The Tesla Model X Standard Range has a maximum power of 381KW (518hp). The total torque is 700nm. It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 4,2 seconds. The top speed is 250 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 100kWh and a net capacity of 75kWh, meaning you have a 25kWh buffer for protection. (25,0%). 

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 543 to 528 km (337-328 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 13,8kWh/100km for the basic version and 14,2kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 250kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 62 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 24 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 5% to 50%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss on 132kW. Each charge session would take 15 minutes and 20 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 24,0kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 34 minutes to drive. This trip will require five charge session(s) charging from 5% to 49%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 75 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 49 minutes. 

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear corner](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-corner). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**NACS**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#nacs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
