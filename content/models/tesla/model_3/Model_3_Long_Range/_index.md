## Performance

The Tesla Model 3 Long Range has a maximum power of 324KW (441hp). The total torque is 493nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 4,4 seconds. The top speed is 233 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 82kWh and a net capacity of 75kWh, meaning you have a 7kWh buffer for protection. (8,5%).  The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 602 km (374 mi).   The consumption is 12,5kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 250kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 68 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 32 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 5% to 43% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 119kW. Each charge session would take 14 minutes and 23 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 17,5kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 11 minutes to drive. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 5% to 39%. The total time lost for charging will be 52 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 49 minutes.

The Tesla Model 3 Long Range has a [**lane keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Blind spot monitoring**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/blindspotmonitoring/) is a standard driver assist system. This side assist system helps to detect traffic in blind spots. 

The Tesla Model 3 Long Range has a [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/)  as a standard system. This system help prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.

### Driving Automation

The Tesla Model 3 Long Range offers [driving automation on level 2 or 3]](../../../../technology/driverassistance/#level-of-autonomous-driving), depending on the equipment level. 

With the Basic Autopilot  level 2 system, you get the following driving automation features. 
- [**Adaptive Cruise control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/adaptivecruisecontrol/) 
- [**Autosteer**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/autosteer/): keeps the car in your lane and slows down if needed in traffic. The system limits how long you can drive without touching the steering wheel. 


With the Enhanced Autopilot  level 2 system, you get additional driving automation features to the ones listed above. 
- Advance cruise control that follows navigation and turns off and on major roads to reach the target by itself. 
- [**Automatic parking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticparking/).  
- [**Automatic lane change**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automatedlanechange/) 


With the Full Self-Driving Capability  level 3 system, you get additional driving automation features to the ones listed above.
