## Performance

The Tesla Model 3 Long Range delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 324 kW (441 hp / 435 bhp) and a total torque of 493 Nm (364 lb-ft). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 4.4 seconds and reaches a top speed of 201 km/h (125 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 82 kWh and a net usable capacity of 75 kWh, providing an 7 kWh buffer (8.5%) for battery protection.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 629 km (391 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 11.9 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 250 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 68 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 32 minutes with an average charging speed at 97 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 5% to 43%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 119 kW, with each charging session taking about 14 minutes and 23 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 17.3 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 10 minutes. This journey would require four charging stops from 5% to 38%, with a total charging time of 51 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 49 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear corner](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-corner). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**NACS**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#nacs) for North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for Europe. See full specifications for all markets.
