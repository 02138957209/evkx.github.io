## Performance

The Tesla Model 3 Long Range has a maximum power of 324KW (441hp). The total torque is 493nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 4,4 seconds. The top speed is 233 kph. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 82kWh and a net capacity of 75kWh, meaning you have a 7kWh buffer for protection. (8,5%).  The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 602 km (374 mi).   The consumption is 12,5kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 250kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 68 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 32 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 5% to 43% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 119kW. Each charge session would take 14 minutes and 23 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 17,5kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 11 minutes to drive. This will requires four charge sessions charging from 5% to 39%. The total time lost for charging will be 52 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 49 minutes.
