## Performance

The Tesla Model 3 offers modest performance with a maximum power of 208 kW (283 hp / 279 bhp) and a total torque of 420 Nm (310 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 6.1 seconds and has a top speed of 225 km/h (140 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 60 kWh and a net usable capacity of 59 kWh, providing an 1 kWh buffer (1.7%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 340 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. The Lithium-Ion battery uses [LFP technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp) This has some benefits and disadvantages from the typical NCA/NCM batteries.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 513 km (319 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 11.5 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 170 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 70 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 32 minutes with an average charging speed at 78 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 3% to 49%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 83 kW, with each charging session taking about 20 minutes and 31 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 17 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 41 minutes. This journey would require four charging stops from 3% to 51%, with a total charging time of 82 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 5 hours and 21 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The charge port is conveniently located at the [left rear corner](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-corner) of the vehicle, facilitating easy access when backing into charging stations. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**NACS**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#nacs) for North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
