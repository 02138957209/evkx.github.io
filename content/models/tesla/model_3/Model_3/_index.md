We also have an overview of the [full specifications](specifications), an [image gallery](gallery), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve), and some [online reviews](reviews). Our sections:

## Performance

The Tesla Model 3 has a maximum power of 208KW (283hp). The total torque is 420nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 6,1 seconds. The top speed is 225 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 60kWh and a net capacity of 57,5kWh, meaning you have a 2,5kWh buffer for protection. (4,2%). The battery is a Lithium-Ion battery based on [LFP technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp) This has some benefits and disadvantages from the typical NCA/NCM batteries. The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 495 to 491 km (308-305 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 11,6kWh/100km for the basic version and 11,7kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 170kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 68 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 31 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 3% to 49% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 83kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 9 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 17kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 41 minutes to drive. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 3% to 52%. The total time lost for charging will be 82 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 5 hours and 13 minutes.

## Advanced driver assistance systems

The Tesla Model 3 has several standard and optional [advanced driver assistance systems](../../../../technology/driverassistance/)  (ADAS) for better safety and comfort.
### Safety systems



The Tesla Model 3 has a [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The Tesla Model 3 has a [**Electronic Stability Control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/electronicstabilitycontrol/)  as a standard system that is designed to improve the stability and handling of a vehicle during sudden maneuvers or slippery road conditions.

The Tesla Model 3 has a [**lane keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Front Cross Traffic Assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/frontcrosstrafficassist/) is a standard driver assist system that helps drivers detect oncoming traffic when crossing an intersection or turning left or right from a stopped position. 

[**Forward Collision Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/) is a standard driver assist system that is designed to help drivers avoid or mitigate frontal collisions. 

The Tesla Model 3 has a [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/)  as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.

[**Automatic emergency steering**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencysteering/) is a standard  driver assist system designed to help drivers avoid collisions by automatically steering the vehicle in an emergency. 

[**Blind spot monitoring**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/blindspotmonitoring/) is a standard driver assist system. This side assist system helps to detect traffic in blind spots. 

### Driving Automation

The Tesla Model 3 offers [driving automation on level 2 or 3](../../../../technology/driverassistance/#level-of-autonomous-driving), depending on the equipment level. 

With the Basic Autopilot  level 2 system, you get the following driving automation features. 
- [**Adaptive Cruise control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/adaptivecruisecontrol/) 
- [**Autosteer**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/autosteer/): keeps the car in your lane and slows down if needed in traffic. The system limits how long you can drive without touching the steering wheel. 


With the Enhanced Autopilot  level 2 system, you get additional driving automation features to the ones listed above. 
- Advance cruise control that follows navigation and turns off and on major roads to reach the target by itself. 
- [**Automatic parking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticparking/).  
- [**Automatic lane change**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automatedlanechange/) 


With the Full Self-Driving Capability  level 3 system, you get additional driving automation features to the ones listed above.
- Traffic light control - follow traffic lights. 
- Stop sign control - follow stop signs.
