## Performance

The Tesla Model 3 Performance delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 393 kW (534 hp / 527 bhp) and a total torque of 660 Nm (487 lb-ft). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 3.3 seconds and reaches a top speed of 261 km/h (162 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 78,1 kWh and a net usable capacity of 75 kWh, providing an 3,1 kWh buffer (4.0%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 357 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 528 km (328 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 14.2 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 250 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 67 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 32 minutes with an average charging speed at 97 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 5% to 43%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 118 kW, with each charging session taking about 15 minutes and 33 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 17.5 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 12 minutes. This journey would require four charging stops from 5% to 39%, with a total charging time of 52 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 6 hours and 49 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The charge port is conveniently located at the [left rear corner](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-corner) of the vehicle, facilitating easy access when backing into charging stations. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**NACS**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#nacs) for North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
