## Performance

The Tesla Model Y Long Range has a maximum power of 324 KW (441 hp/435 bhp) and a total torque of 493 nm (364 ft-lb). It can sprint from 0 to 100km/h (0 to 62mph) in 5 seconds and has a top speed of 217 km/h (134.9 mph).

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 82kWh and a net capacity of 79kWh, meaning you have a 3kWh buffer for protection. (3.7%).

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) varies from 542 to 533 km (337-331 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range. The consumption is between 14.6kWh/100km for the basic version and 14.8kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 250kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 65 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 33 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 5% to 45%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 111kW. Each charge session would take 17 minutes and 8 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 19.5kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 23 minutes. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 5% to 42%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 64 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 10 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear corner](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-corner). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**NACS**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#nacs) for North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for Europe. See full specifications for all markets.
