## Performance

The Tesla Model Y Performance has a maximum power of 393KW (534hp). The total torque is 660nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 3,7 seconds. The top speed is 250 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 82kWh and a net capacity of 75kWh, meaning you have a 7kWh buffer for protection. (8,5%). 

 The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 514 km (319 mi).   The consumption is 14,6kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 250kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 62 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 31 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 5% to 46%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss on 109kW. Each charge session would take 17 minutes and 55 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 19,5kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 26 minutes to drive. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 5% to 45%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 66 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 49 minutes. 

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear corner](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-corner). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**NACS**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#nacs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Tesla Model Y Performance has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/) at the front axle and [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/) at the rear axle. 

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The standard suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 167 mm. 

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Tesla Model Y Performance. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. 

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 355mm, and the rear discs are 355mm. 

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available through [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) or coasting is not available in this model. You can choose between three stopping modes for one-pedal driving. Hold mode stops the car completely using friction brakes, roll mode causes the vehicle to roll until it stops by itself, and creep mode will creep the car forward at low speed. You can adjust how strong regen you get when you lift the foot. There are two levels.

## Exterior

You can choose between 5 different paint colors when ordering this model. 
Additionally, you can choose between 3 wheels with sizes from 19 to 21 inches. 

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). 

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof has a large panoramic roof extending from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car's interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted.

### Safety systems



The Tesla Model Y Performance has an [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The Tesla Model Y Performance has an [**Electronic Stability Control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/electronicstabilitycontrol/)  as a a standard system designed to improve a vehicle's stability and handling during sudden maneuvers or slippery road conditions. 

The Tesla Model Y Performance has a [**lane-keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has a [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Front Cross Traffic Assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/frontcrosstrafficassist/) is a standard driver assist system that helps drivers detect oncoming traffic when crossing an intersection or turning left or right from a stopped position. 

[**Forward Collision Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/) is a standard driver assist system to help drivers avoid or mitigate frontal collisions. 

The Tesla Model Y Performance has an [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/)  as a a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.

[**Automatic emergency steering**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencysteering/) is a standard  driver assist system designed to help drivers avoid collisions by automatically steering the vehicle in an emergency. 

[**Blind-spot monitoring**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/blindspotmonitoring/) is a standard driver-assist system. This side assist system helps to detect traffic in blind spots. 

### Driving Automation

The Tesla Model Y Performance offers [driving automation on level 2 or 3](../../../../technology/driverassistance/#level-of-autonomous-driving), depending on the equipment level.
