## Performance

The Tesla Model Y Standard Range has a maximum power of 255 KW (347 hp/342 bhp). The total torque is 420 nm (310 ft-lb). It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 6,9 seconds. The top speed is 217 km/h.

## Battery, range, and charging

Tesla Model Y Standard Range has three battery options with different specifications. Below you see how this affects range and charging.
### CATL LFP Europa/China market

The battery has a gross capacity of 60kWh and a net capacity of 55kWh, meaning you have a 5kWh buffer for protection. (8,3%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [LFP technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp) This has some benefits and disadvantages from the typical NCA/NCM batteries.

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) is 430 km (267 mi). The consumption is 12.8kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 250kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 52 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 27 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 0% to 47%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 89kW. Each charge session would take 17 minutes and 30 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 19,5kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 55 minutes. This trip will require five charge session(s) charging from 0% to 51%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 95 minutes.
### BYD LFP Europa/China market

The battery has a gross capacity of 60kWh and a net capacity of 55kWh, meaning you have a 5kWh buffer for protection. (8,3%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [LFP technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp) This has some benefits and disadvantages from the typical NCA/NCM batteries.

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) is 430 km (267 mi). The consumption is 12.8kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 250kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 37 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 18 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 0% to 63%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 113kW. Each charge session would take 18 minutes and 28 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 19,5kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 35 minutes. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 0% to 64%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 75 minutes.
### NMC 4850 US Market

The battery has a gross capacity of 70kWh and a net capacity of 68,5kWh, meaning you have a 1,5kWh buffer for protection. (2,1%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) is 430 km (267 mi). The consumption is 12.8kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 250kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 84 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 41 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 0% to 36%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 82kW. Each charge session would take 18 minutes and 60 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 19,5kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 52 minutes. This trip will require five charge session(s) charging from 0% to 37%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 93 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 5 hours and 0 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear corner](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-corner). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**NACS**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#nacs) for North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for Europe. See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Tesla Model Y Standard Range has a rear-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the rear axle. The motor(s) used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The standard suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 167 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Tesla Model Y Standard Range. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 355mm, and the rear discs are 355mm.

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available through [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) or coasting is not available in this model. You can choose between three stopping modes for one-pedal driving. Hold mode stops the car completely using friction brakes, roll mode causes the vehicle to roll until it stops by itself, and creep mode will creep the car forward at low speed. You can adjust how strong regen you get when you lift the foot. There are two levels.

## Exterior

You can choose between 5 different paint colors when ordering this model.
Additionally, you can choose between 3 wheels with sizes from 19 to 21 inches.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate).

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof has a large panoramic roof extending from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car's interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted.
