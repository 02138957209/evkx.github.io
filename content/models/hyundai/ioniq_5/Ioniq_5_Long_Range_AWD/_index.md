## Performance

The Hyundai Ioniq 5 Long Range AWD has a maximum power of 239KW (325hp). The total torque is 605nm. It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 5,1 seconds. The top speed is 185 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 77,4kWh and a net capacity of 74kWh, meaning you have a 3,4kWh buffer for protection. (4,4%). 

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) varies from 481 to 454 km (299-282 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 15.4kWh/100km for the basic version and 16.3kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 233kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 38 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 16 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 76%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 152kW. Each charge session would take 22 minutes and 59 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 24kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 25 minutes. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 1% to 76%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 66 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 43 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
