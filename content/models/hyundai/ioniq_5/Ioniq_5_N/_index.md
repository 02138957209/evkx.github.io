## Performance

With overboost, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N reaches a maximum power of 478 kW (650 hp / 641 bhp). Without overboost, it provides a strong 448 kW (609 hp / 601 bhp). The maxium torque is at 770 Nm (568 ft-lb). This powerhouse can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 3.4 seconds and reaches a top speed of 260 km/h (162 mph), showcasing its impressive performance.

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 84kWh and a net capacity of 80kWh, meaning you have a 4kWh buffer for protection. (4.8%).

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) is 450 km (280 mi). The consumption is 17.8kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 233kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 41 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 18 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 76%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 154kW. Each charge session would take 23 minutes and 21 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 26kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 30 minutes. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 1% to 76%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 70 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 16 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
