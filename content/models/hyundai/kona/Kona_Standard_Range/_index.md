## Performance

The Hyundai Kona Standard Range offers modest performance with a maximum power of 160 kW (218 hp / 215 bhp) and a total torque of 255 Nm (188 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 7.3 seconds and has a top speed of 185 km/h (115 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 51 kWh and a net usable capacity of 48,4 kWh, providing a 2,6 kWh buffer (5.1%) for battery protection.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 377 km (234 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 12.8 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 100 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 53 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 27 minutes with an average charging speed at 74 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 4% to 66%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 65 kW, with each charging session taking about 28 minutes and 49 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 23 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 11 hours and 9 minutes. This journey would require six charging stops from 4% to 67%, with a total charging time of 170 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 4 hours and 23 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [front](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to park with the front in. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Hyundai Kona Standard Range has a front-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the front axle.

### Suspension

The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 178 mm.

### Brakes

### Regenerative Braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in two modes. You can use [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) or you can coast and use the [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal) to regen. The system stops the car completely using friction brakes.

## Exterior

The Hyundai Kona Standard Range, with dimensions of 4355 mm in length, 1825 mm in width, and 1575 mm in height, falls into the B-SUV segment cars, also known as subcompact SUVs or crossovers, offer a combination of the compact size and maneuverability of B-segment cars with the higher driving position, increased cargo space, and rugged styling of an SUV. The Hyundai Kona Standard Range offers a selection of 21 paint colors, featuring solid, metallic, pearlescent, and matte options.

You can select from multiple wheel options in different sizes on the Hyundai Kona Standard Range, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 215/60 tires on 17" rims
- 235/45 tires on 19" rims

More narrow wheels will improve consumption and give a longer range, while wider wheels will provide better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [hatchback-style liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#hatcback-style-liftgate).

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a sunroof. The glass extends over only the front row, and occupants can open it. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

Additionally, you can order the car with tinted windows from the B-pillar backward, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
