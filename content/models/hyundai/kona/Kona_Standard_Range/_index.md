## Performance

The Hyundai Kona Standard Range has a maximum power of 160 KW (218 hp/215 bhp) and a total torque of 255 nm (188 ft-lb). It can sprint from 0 to 100km/h (0 to 62mph) in 7.3 seconds and has a top speed of 185 km/h (115.0 mph).

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 51kWh and a net capacity of 48,4kWh, meaning you have a 2,6kWh buffer for protection. (5.1%).

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) is 377 km (234 mi). The consumption is 12.8kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 100kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 53 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 27 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 4% to 66%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 65kW. Each charge session would take 28 minutes and 49 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 23kWh/100km, 1000km will take 11 hours and 9 minutes. This trip will require six charge session(s) charging from 4% to 67%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 170 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 4 hours and 23 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [front](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to park with the front in. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
