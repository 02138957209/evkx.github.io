Peugeot has announced an all-electric strategy in Europe by 2030, which means that from 2030 onwards, new Peugeot cars will only be available as fully electric in Europe. However, other international markets will continue to sell petrol and diesel Peugeot cars. Peugeot's electrification strategy is based on the E-Lion Project, which is a holistic approach that covers five aspects: ecosystem, experience, electric, efficiency and environment. Peugeot aims to have a 100% electric offer by 2025 and to achieve carbon net zero by 2038.<br /><br/>Peugeot plans to launch five new electric vehicles in two years: E-308, E-308 SW (first European electric estate), E-408, E-3008 and E-5008. The electric 308 and 308 SW will be powered by a new electric engine that develops 156 hp and has a range of over 400 km. The E-3008 will be the first car launched with the new state-of-the-art STLA Medium platform, which will offer a range of up to 700 km and three electric powertrains, including dual motor. Peugeot will also introduce new hybrid technology with MHEV 48v, which will reduce fuel consumption and emissions by 15% compared to conventional enginesh
