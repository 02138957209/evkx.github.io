## Performance

The Peugot E-3008 Long Range offers modest performance with a maximum power of 157 kW (214 hp / 211 bhp) and a total torque of 345 Nm (255 ft-lb). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 9 seconds and has a top speed of 170 km/h (106 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The electric vehicle features a high-capacity battery with a gross capacity of 98 kWh and a net usable capacity of 98 kWh, providing an 0 kWh buffer (3.6%) for battery protection. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) is 700 km (435 mi). The consumption is 14.0kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 160 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 110 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 56 minutes with an average charging speed at 74 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 5% to 56%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 74 kW, with each charging session taking about 41 minutes and 45 seconds..

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 25kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 24 minutes. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 5% to 57%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 125 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 8 hours and 54 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
