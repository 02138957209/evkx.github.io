## Performance

The Peugot E-3008 offers modest performance with a maximum power of 157 kW (214 hp / 211 bhp) and a total torque of 345 Nm (255 ft-lb). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 8.8 seconds and has a top speed of170 km/h (106 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 77kWh and a net capacity of 73kWh, meaning you have a 4kWh buffer for protection. (5.2%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) varies from 527 to 512 km (328-318 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range. The consumption is between 13.9kWh/100km for the basic version and 14.3kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 160kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 82 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 41 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 5% to 56%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 71kW. Each charge session would take 32 minutes and 38 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 25kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 52 minutes. This trip will require five charge session(s) charging from 6% to 55%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 152 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 38 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Peugot E-3008 has a front-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the front axle.

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Torsion Beam](../../../../technology/suspension/#torsion-beam). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 198 mm.

### Brakes



[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in two modes. You can use [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) or you can coast and use the [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal) to regen. At low speeds, the one-pedal drive mode will keep the car rolling until it stops by itself. You can adjust how strong regen you get when you lift the foot. There are three levels.

## Exterior

You can choose between 6 different paint colors when ordering this model.
Additionally, you can choose between 2 wheels with sizes from 19 to 20 inches.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate).

You can choose between two types of roofs on this model. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the carâ€™s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted.

## Advanced driver assistance systems

The Peugot E-3008 has several standard and optional [advanced driver assistance systems](../../../../technology/driverassistance/)  (ADAS) for better safety and comfort.
### Safety systems



The Peugot E-3008 has an [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The Peugot E-3008 has a [**lane-keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has a [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Rear Cross Traffic Alert**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/rearcrosstrafficalert/) is an optional driver assist system that uses sensors to detect approaching vehicles from the side when backing out of a parking space or driveway.

The Peugot E-3008 has [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/) as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.

[**Blind-spot monitoring**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/blindspotmonitoring/) is an optional driver-assist system. This side assist system helps to detect traffic in blind spots.

### Driving Automation

The Peugot E-3008 offers [driving automation on level 1 or 2](../../../../technology/driverassistance/#level-of-autonomous-driving), depending on the equipment level.

With the Drive Assist  level 1 system, you get the following driving automation features.
- [**Adaptive Cruise control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/adaptivecruisecontrol/)


With the Drive Assist Plus  level 2 system, you get additional driving automation features to the ones listed above.
- [**Lane Centering Assist (LCA) /AutoSteer**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/autosteer/): keeps the car in your lane and slows down if needed in traffic. The system limits how long you can drive without touching the steering wheel.

### Sensors & Cameras

This model uses cameras, radar, and ultrasonic sensors for the driver assist systems.
Up to three [radar sensors](../../../../technology/sensorsandcameras/radar/), five [cameras](../../../../technology/sensorsandcameras/cameras/), and 12 [ultrasonic sensors](../../../../technology/sensorsandcameras/ultrasonic/) register everything that happens in the vehicle's environment.
