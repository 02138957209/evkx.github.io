## Performance

The Peugot E-208 has a maximum power of 115KW (156hp). The total torque is 260nm. It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 8,1 seconds. The top speed is 150 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 51kWh and a net capacity of 48,1kWh, meaning you have a 2,9kWh buffer for protection. (5,7%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc) 

 The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 400 km (249 mi).   The consumption is 12.0kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 100kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 54 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 27 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 4% to 57%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 65kW. Each charge session would take 23 minutes and 23 seconds. 

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 4 hours and 22 minutes. 

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
