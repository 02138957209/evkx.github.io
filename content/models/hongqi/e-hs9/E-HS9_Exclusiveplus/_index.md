## Performance

The Hongqi E-HS9 Exclusive+ packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 405 kW (551 hp / 543 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 670 Nm (494 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 4.9 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 120 kWh and a net usable capacity of 110 kWh, providing an 10 kWh buffer (8.3%) for battery protection.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 515 km (320 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 21.4 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 135 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 114 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 62 minutes with an average charging speed at 74 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 0% to 39%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 87 kW, with each charging session taking about 30 minutes and 35 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 32 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 46 minutes. This journey would require six charging stops from 1% to 33%, with a total charging time of 147 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 10 hours and 0 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

Hongqi E-HS9 Exclusive+ features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 170 mm, and the maximum is 260 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Hongqi E-HS9 Exclusive+. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes).

### Regenerative braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) in this model is primarily facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). Unlike some models, [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) or coasting is not available here.

## Exterior

The Hongqi E-HS9 Exclusive+, with dimensions of 5209 mm in length, 2010 mm in width, and 1713 mm in height, falls into the Full-size SUVs offer the most space, power, and capability among SUV categories, making them suitable for a specific set of drivers with unique needs The Hongqi E-HS9 Exclusive+ is available in a total of 6 paint colors, including several striking metallic options.

More narrow wheels will improve consumption and give a longer range, while wider wheels will provide better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). Soft close is a standard function for the side doors.

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof has a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.
