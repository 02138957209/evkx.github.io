## Performance

The Hongqi E-HS9 Exclusive has a maximum power of 405KW (551hp). The total torque is 670nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 4,9 seconds. The top speed is 200 kph. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 99kWh and a net capacity of 90kWh, meaning you have a 9kWh buffer for protection. (9,1%).  The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 465 km (289 mi).   The consumption is 19,4kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 135kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 74 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 35 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 7% to 70% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 95kW. Each charge session would take 36 minutes and 49 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 32kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 45 minutes to drive. This will requires four charge sessions charging from 7% to 71%. The total time lost for charging will be 146 minutes.   
### Onboard charger
