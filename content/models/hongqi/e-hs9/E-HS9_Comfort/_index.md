## Performance

The Hongqi E-HS9 Comfort offers modest performance with a maximum power of 320 kW (435 hp / 429 bhp) and a total torque of 300 Nm (221 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 6.5 seconds and has a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 84 kWh and a net usable capacity of 81,7 kWh, providing an 2,3 kWh buffer (2.7%) for battery protection.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 396 km (246 mi). The consumption is 20.6kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 135 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 67 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 32 minutes with an average charging speed at 107 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 7% to 72%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 94 kW, with each charging session taking about 34 minutes and 1 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 32 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 53 minutes. This journey would require four charging stops from 6% to 79%, with a total charging time of 153 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 25 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
