The E-HS9 is designed by former Rolls-Royce designer Giles Taylor and has a range of up to 515 km (WLTP) with a 120 kWh battery pack.<br /><br />Hongqi also has plans to launch more electric models in the future, such as the E-QM5, a luxury sedan, and the E-HS7, a mid-size SUV. Hongqi aims to become a global leader in the premium electric car segment and to compete with brands like Tesla, Mercedes-Benz and Audi.<br /><br />Hongqi has expanded into Europe since 2020, starting with Norway as its first overseas market.
