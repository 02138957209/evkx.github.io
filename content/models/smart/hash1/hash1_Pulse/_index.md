## Performance

The Smart #1 Pulse has a maximum power of 315KW (428hp). The total torque is 584nm. It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 4,5 seconds. The top speed is 180 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 66kWh and a net capacity of 62kWh, meaning you have a 4kWh buffer for protection. (6,1%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc) 

 The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 400 km (249 mi).   The consumption is 15.5kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 150kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 80 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 30 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 5% to 54%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 89kW. Each charge session would take 20 minutes and 29 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 26kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 34 minutes. This trip will require seven charge session(s) charging from 5% to 51%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 135 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 22KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 2 hours and 49 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Smart #1 Pulse has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. 

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 175 mm. 

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 350mm, and the rear discs are 333mm. 

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available through [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal). [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. At low speeds, the one-pedal drive mode will keep the car creeping forward. You can adjust how strong regen you get when you lift the foot. There are two levels.

## Exterior

You can choose between 6 different paint colors when ordering this model. 

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [hatchback-style liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#hatcback-style-liftgate). 

You can choose between two types of roofs on this model. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a large panoramic roof extending over most of the areas from the front to the rear. This glass makes the carâ€™s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

## Interior

The seat layout is the traditional five seats with two in front and three in the rear. 

### First row seats

Only one front seat type is available in the Smart #1 Pulse. 

The following functionalities are available on the **** seat. 

- [heating](../../../../technology/seats/adjustment/#heating) 
- [electric lumbar support](../../../../technology/seats/adjustment/#lumbar-support) 
- [adjustable thigh support](../../../../technology/seats/adjustment/#thigh-support-adjustment) 

You can choose from 1 different materials/colors for this seat type. 
- White & Blue [leatherette upholstering](../../../../technology/seats/materials/#leatherette)



### Second-row seat



The second row has a standard three-seat bench with a  split where you can fold each section separately to increase the cargo space.  In addition, the following functionalities are available. 

- [heating](../../../../technology/seats/adjustment/#heating) 

There is only one type of steering wheel available. 

## Climate system

You can choose from two different climate systems. The  climate system supports only controlling one shared zone for the whole car. The  climate system supports different temperatures in two zones for the driver and passenger. This model has a [heat pump](../../../../technology/hvac/#heat-pump) as standard. This heat pump can save significant energy that the EV would use for heating in cold weather.

## Comfort

Smart #1 Pulse has several features to make your life as a driver or passenger more comfortable. 

Keyless entry allows access to the car without needing to find the key. As long you bring it with you, the doors open. 

Keyless go makes it possible to start the car without using the key. 

You have wireless charging for your phone.

## Advanced driver assistance systems

The Smart #1 Pulse has several standard and optional [advanced driver assistance systems](../../../../technology/driverassistance/)  (ADAS) for better safety and comfort.

[**Efficiency Assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/efficencyassist/) is a standard system that helps drivers to drive preemptively and save energy. 
### Safety systems



The Smart #1 Pulse has an [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The Smart #1 Pulse has an [**Electronic Stability Control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/electronicstabilitycontrol/)  as a standard system designed to improve a vehicle's stability and handling during sudden maneuvers or slippery road conditions. 

The Smart #1 Pulse has a [**lane-keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has a [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Rear Cross Traffic Alert**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/rearcrosstrafficalert/) is a standard driver assist system that uses sensors to detect approaching vehicles from the side when backing out of a parking space or driveway. 

[**Forward Collision Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/) is a standard driver assist system to help drivers avoid or mitigate frontal collisions. 

The Smart #1 Pulse has [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/) as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.

[**Exit Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/exitwarning/) is a standard driver-assist system designed to warn occupants against opening doors if there is a risk of hitting something. 

### Driving Automation



With the Pilot Assist  level 2 system, you get the following driving automation features. 
- [**Adaptive Cruise control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/adaptivecruisecontrol/) 
- [**Autosteer**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/autosteer/): keeps the car in your lane and slows down if needed in traffic. The system limits how long you can drive without touching the steering wheel. 
- [**Automatic parking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticparking/). (optional) 
- [**Automatic lane change**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automatedlanechange/)
