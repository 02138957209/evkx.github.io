## Performance

The Smart #1 delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 315 kW (428 hp / 422 bhp) and a total torque of 584 Nm (431 lb-ft). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 3.9 seconds and reaches a top speed of 180 km/h (112 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 66 kWh and a net usable capacity of 62 kWh, providing an 4 kWh buffer (6.1%) for battery protection. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 440 to 420 km (274-261 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels, for instance, can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 14.1 kWh/100 km for the base model and 14.8 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 150 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 80 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 30 minutes with an average charging speed at 87 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 5% to 54%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 89 kW, with each charging session taking about 20 minutes and 29 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 26 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 34 minutes. This journey would require seven charging stops from 5% to 51%, with a total charging time of 135 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 22 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 2 hours and 49 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
