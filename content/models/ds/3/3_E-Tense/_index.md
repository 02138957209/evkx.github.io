## Performance

The DS 3 E-Tense has a maximum power of 115KW (156hp). The total torque is 260nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 9 seconds. The top speed is 150 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 54kWh and a net capacity of 50,8kWh, meaning you have a 3,2kWh buffer for protection. (5,9%). The battery is a Lithium-Ion battery based on [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc) The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 402 to 396 km (250-246 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 12,6kWh/100km for the basic version and 12,8kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 100kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 62 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 34 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 4% to 53% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 61kW. Each charge session would take 24 minutes and 29 seconds. 
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 4 hours and 37 minutes.
