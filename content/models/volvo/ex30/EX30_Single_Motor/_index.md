## Performance

The Volvo EX30 Single Motor offers modest performance with a maximum power of 200 kW (272 hp / 268 bhp) and a total torque of 343 Nm (253 ft-lb). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.3 seconds and has a top speed of 180 km/h (112 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The electric vehicle features a high-capacity battery with a gross capacity of 51 kWh and a net usable capacity of 49 kWh, providing an 2 kWh buffer (3.6%) for battery protection. The Lithium-Ion battery uses [LFP technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp) This has some benefits and disadvantages from the typical NCA/NCM batteries.

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) is 344 km (214 mi). The consumption is 14.2kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 153 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 63 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 24 minutes with an average charging speed at 87 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 4% to 56%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 84 kW, with each charging session taking about 18 minutes and 15 seconds..

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 28kWh/100km, 1000km will take 11 hours and 7 minutes. This trip will require eight charge session(s) charging from 3% to 62%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 167 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the standard onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 4 hours and 27 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Volvo EX30 Single Motor has a rear-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the rear axle.

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 175 mm.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 350mm, and the rear discs are 333mm.

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in two modes. You can use [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) or you can coast and use the [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal) to regen. The system stops the car completely using friction brakes.

## Exterior

You can choose between 5 different paint colors when ordering this model.
Additionally, you can choose between 2 wheels with sizes from 18 to 20 inches.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [hatchback-style liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#hatcback-style-liftgate).

You can choose between two types of roofs on this model. As an option, you can order this model with a large panoramic roof extending from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car's interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.

### First row seats

Only one front seat type is available in the Volvo EX30 Single Motor.

The following functionalities are available on the **** seat.

- [heating](../../../../technology/seats/adjustment/#heating)
- [electric lumbar support](../../../../technology/seats/adjustment/#lumbar-support)
- [adjustable thigh support](../../../../technology/seats/adjustment/#thigh-support-adjustment)

You can choose from 4 different materials/colors for this seat type.
- White [fabric/leatherette upholstering](../../../../technology/seats/materials/#fabric)
- Grey [wool upholstering](../../../../technology/seats/materials/#wool)
- Brown [wool/leatherette upholstering](../../../../technology/seats/materials/#wool)
- Blue [fabric/leatherette upholstering](../../../../technology/seats/materials/#fabric)



### Second-row seat



The second row has a standard three-seat bench with a  split where you can fold each section separately to increase the cargo space. In addition, the following functionalities are available.

- [heating](../../../../technology/seats/adjustment/#heating)


{{< sitefiguresized thumb="models/volvo/ex30/ex30_single_motor/secondrowseats_1_st.jpg" title="Volvo EX30 Single Motor" width="3000" height="2250"  >}}

## Climate system

You can choose from two different climate systems. The  climate system supports only controlling one shared zone for the whole car. The  climate system supports different temperatures in two zones for the driver and passenger. This model has a [heat pump](../../../../technology/hvac/#heat-pump) as standard. This heat pump can save significant energy that the EV would use for heating in cold weather.

## Comfort

Volvo EX30 Single Motor has several features to make your life as a driver or passenger more comfortable.

Keyless entry allows access to the car without needing to find the key. As long you bring it with you, the doors open.
