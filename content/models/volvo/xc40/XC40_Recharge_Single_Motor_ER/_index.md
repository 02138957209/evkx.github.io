## Performance

The Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor ER has a maximum power of 185KW (252hp). The total torque is 420nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 7,3 seconds. The top speed is 160 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 82kWh and a net capacity of 79kWh, meaning you have a 3kWh buffer for protection. (3,7%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc) 

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 572 to 553 km (356-344 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 13,8kWh/100km for the basic version and 14,3kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 205kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 65 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 28 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 1% to 50% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 119kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 27 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 28kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 1 minutes to drive. This trip will require five charge session(s) charging from 1% to 52%. The total time lost for charging will be 101 minutes.   

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 10 minutes. 

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This makes it easy for charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
