## Performance

The Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor ER has a maximum power of 185KW (252hp). The total torque is 420nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 7,3 seconds. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 82kWh and a net capacity of 79kWh, meaning you have a 3kWh buffer for protection. (3,7%). Depending on car options, the [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 572 to 553 km (356-344 mi). Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 13,8kWh/100km for the basic version and 14,3kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 205kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 102 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 38 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 5% to 51% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 94kW. Each charge session would take 23 minutes and 11 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 28kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 28 minutes to drive. This trip will require five charge session(s) charging from 4% to 55%. The total time lost for charging will be 129 minutes.
