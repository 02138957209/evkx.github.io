## Performance

The Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance has a maximum power of 380KW (517hp). The total torque is 910nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 4,7 seconds. The top speed is 210 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 111kWh and a net capacity of 107kWh, meaning you have a 4kWh buffer for protection. (3,6%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)  The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 580 km (360 mi).   The consumption is 18,4kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 250kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 68 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 32 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 4% to 54% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 136kW. Each charge session would take 24 minutes and 31 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 28kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 36 minutes to drive. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 3% to 57%. The total time lost for charging will be 76 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 9 hours and 43 minutes.

## Drivetrain

Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. 

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 188 mm, and the max is 248 mm. 

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 400mm, and the rear discs are 390mm. 

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available through [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal). [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive)r coasting is not available in this model.
