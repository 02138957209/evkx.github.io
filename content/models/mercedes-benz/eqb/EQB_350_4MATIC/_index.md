## Performance

The Mercedes-Benz EQB 350 4MATIC has a maximum power of 215KW (292hp). The total torque is 520nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 6,2 seconds. The top speed is 160 kph. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a net capacity of 66,5kWh. The range varies based on the equipment trim. Based on the WLTP standard test, the range varies from 423km to 388km, depending on the equipment. The consumption is between 15,7kWh/100km for the basic version and 17,1kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 112kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 44 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 29 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 3% to 76% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 85kW. Each charge session would take 34 minutes and 26 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 25kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 30 minutes to drive. This will requires three charge sessions charging from 3% to 95%. The total time lost for charging will be 130 minutes.   

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 2 minutes.
