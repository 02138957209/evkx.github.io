## Performance

The Audi Q4 35 e-tron has a maximum power of 125KW (170hp). The total torque is 310nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 9 seconds. The top speed is 160 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 55kWh and a net capacity of 51,5kWh, meaning you have a 3,5kWh buffer for protection. (6,4%). The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 357 to 323 km (222-201 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 14,4kWh/100km for the basic version and 15,9kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 125kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 44 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 24 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 6% to 57% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 81kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 21 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 21kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 18 minutes to drive. This trip will require seven charge session(s) charging from 6% to 50%. The total time lost for charging will be 118 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 7,2KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 9 minutes.
