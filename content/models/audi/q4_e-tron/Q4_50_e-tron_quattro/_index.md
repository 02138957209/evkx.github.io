## Performance

With overboost, the Audi Q4 50 e-tron quattro has a maximum power of 220KW (299hp). Without overboost, it is 195KW (265hp). The torque is 460nm with overboost and 425 without overboost. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 6,2 seconds with overboost and 6,9 seconds without overboost. The top speed is 180 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 82kWh and a net capacity of 76,6kWh, meaning you have a 5,4kWh buffer for protection. (6,6%). Depending on car options, the [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 491 to 409 km (305-254 mi). Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 15,6kWh/100km for the basic version and 18,7kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 125kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 65 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 36 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 6% to 53% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 89kW. Each charge session would take 24 minutes and 11 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 23kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 5 minutes to drive. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 6% to 57%. The total time lost for charging will be 105 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 57 minutes.
