## Performance

The Audi Q4 Sportback 45 e-tron quattro has a maximum power of 195KW (265hp). The total torque is 425nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 6,9 seconds. The top speed is 180 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 82kWh and a net capacity of 76,6kWh, meaning you have a 5,4kWh buffer for protection. (6,6%). 

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 524 to 446 km (326-277 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 14,6kWh/100km for the basic version and 17,2kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 125kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 65 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 36 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 6% to 53% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 89kW. Each charge session would take 24 minutes and 11 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 22kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 56 minutes to drive. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 6% to 53%. The total time lost for charging will be 97 minutes.   

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 57 minutes. 

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This makes it easy for charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Audi Q4 Sportback 45 e-tron quattro has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/) at front axle and [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/) at rear axle.
