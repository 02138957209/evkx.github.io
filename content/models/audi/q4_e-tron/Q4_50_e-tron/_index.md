## Performance

With overboost, the Audi Q4 50 e-tron has a maximum power of 300KW (408hp). Without overboost, it is 265KW (360hp). Torque is rated to 664nm with overboost and 561 without overboost. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 5,7 seconds with overboost and 6,6 seconds without overboost. The top speed is 200 kph. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 82kWh and a net capacity of 76,6kWh, meaning you have 5,4kWh reserved as a buffer for protection. (6,6%). The range varies based on the equipment trim. Based on the WLTP standard test, the range varies from 488km to 412km, depending on the equipment. The consumption is between 15,7kWh/100km for the basic version and 18,6kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 125kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 71 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 29 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 7% to 66% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 96kW. Each charge session would take 28 minutes and 10 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 23kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 56 minutes to drive. This will requires three charge sessions charging from 7% to 74%. The total time lost for charging will be 96 minutes.   

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 57 minutes.
