## Performance

With overboost, the Audi Q6 e-tron quattro has a maximum power of 300 KW (408 hp / 402 bhp). Without overboost, it is 285 KW (388 hp / 388 bhp). The torque is 650 nm with overboost and 650 without overboost. It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 5.2 seconds. The top speed is 220 km/h.

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 100kWh and a net capacity of 94,9kWh, meaning you have a 5,1kWh buffer for protection. (5.1%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) varies from 613 to 516 km (381-321 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range. The consumption is between 15.5kWh/100km for the basic version and 18.4kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 270kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 57 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 20 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 3% to 63%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 170kW. Each charge session would take 20 minutes and 4 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 21.5kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 2 minutes. This trip will require two charge session(s) charging from 3% to 67%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 43 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 8 hours and 37 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets. A second port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This extra port gives you more parking options for AC charging. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**J1772**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#j1772) for North America and for Europe, [**TYPE2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#type-2). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Audi Q6 e-tron quattro has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motor(s) used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The Standard suspension has steel springs with a fixed height but an optional damping adjustment. The ground clearance with this suspension is 184 mm. The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 185 mm, and the maximum is 224 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Audi Q6 e-tron quattro. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as an optional feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 410mm, and the rear discs are 365mm.

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in several modes. The most efficient is [automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive). In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking to reduce speed. You can also enable [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving).

## Exterior

You can choose between 13 different paint colors when ordering this model.

You can also choose several styling options to make your car more unique.
Additionally, you can choose between 8 wheels with sizes from 20 to 22 inches.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate).

You can choose between two types of roofs on this model. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the carâ€™s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

You can order the car with tinted windows from B-pillar and back.
