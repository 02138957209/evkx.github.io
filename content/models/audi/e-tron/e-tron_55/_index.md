## Performance

With overboost, the Audi e-tron 55 has a maximum power of 300KW (408hp). Without overboost, it is 265KW (360hp). Torque is rated to 664nm with overboost and 561 without overboost. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 5,7 seconds with overboost and 6,6 seconds without overboost. The top speed is 200 kph. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 95kWh and a net capacity of 86,5kWh, meaning you have 8,5kWh reserved as a buffer for protection. (8,9%). The range varies based on the equipment trim. Based on the WLTP standard test, the range varies from 441km to 369km, depending on the equipment. The consumption is between 19,6kWh/100km for the basic version and 23,4kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 150kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 45 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 26 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 3% to 81% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 118kW. Each charge session would take 34 minutes and 24 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 27kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 54 minutes to drive. This will requires three charge sessions charging from 9% to 80%. The total time lost for charging will be 95 minutes.   

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the standard onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 51 minutes. You can also select an optional onboard charger that supports up to 22KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 3 hours and 55 minutes.
