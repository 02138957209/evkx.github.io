## Performance

With overboost, the Audi e-tron S Sportback has a maximum power of 370KW (503hp). Without overboost, it is 320KW (435hp). The torque is 973nm with overboost and 561 without overboost. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 4,5 seconds with overboost and 6,6 seconds without overboost. The top speed is 200 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 95kWh and a net capacity of 86kWh, meaning you have a 9kWh buffer for protection. (9,5%). The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 379 to 347 km (236-216 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 22,7kWh/100km for the basic version and 24,8kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 150kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 44 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 26 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 3% to 81% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 118kW. Each charge session would take 34 minutes and 14 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 28kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 0 minutes to drive. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 4% to 80%. The total time lost for charging will be 100 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the standard onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 49 minutes. You can also select an optional onboard charger that supports up to 22KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 3 hours and 54 minutes. 

## Drivetrain

Audi e-tron S Sportback has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motor(s) used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/). 

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 152 mm, and the max is 248 mm. 

You can order Audi e-tron S Sportback with an alternative Adaptive Air Suspension Sport suspension. The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink).

The minimum ground clearance is 152 mm, and the max is 248 mm. 

### Steering

Dynamic steering is standard on the Audi e-tron S Sportback. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. 

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 375mm, and the rear discs are 350mm. 

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in several modes. The most efficient is [automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive). In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking to reduce speed. You can also enable [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). 

## Exterior
