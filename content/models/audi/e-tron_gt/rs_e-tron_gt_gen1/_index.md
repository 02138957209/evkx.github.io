## Performance

With overboost, the Audi RS e-tron GT (GEN1) reaches a maximum power of 475 kW (646 hp / 637 bhp). Without overboost, it provides a strong 440 kW (598 hp / 590 bhp). The maxium torque is at 830 Nm (613 lb-ft). This powerhouse can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 3.3 seconds and reaches a top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph), showcasing its impressive performance.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 93,4 kWh and a net usable capacity of 83,7 kWh, providing an 9,7 kWh buffer (10.4%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 725 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 495 to 447 km (308-278 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels, for instance, can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 16.9 kWh/100 km for the base model and 18.7 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 270 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 50 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 18 minutes with an average charging speed at 196 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 3% to 65%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 165 kW, with each charging session taking about 19 minutes and 53 seconds.. This efficient charging capability makes the Audi RS e-tron GT (GEN1) a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 22 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 10 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 3% to 58%, with a total charging time of 51 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 7 hours and 36 minutes using a home charging setup. For faster charging, you can opt for an optional onboard charger that supports up to 22 kW. With this upgrade, you can achieve a full charge from 0 to 100% in just about 3 hours and 48 minutes at home.

## Drivetrain

Audi RS e-tron GT (GEN1) features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The front suspension employs a [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone) design, while the rear uses a [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink) setup. The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The Standard suspension has steel springs with a fixed height, but you can adjust damping to fit your driving style or road condition. The ground clearance with this suspension is 145 mm.

You can order Audi RS e-tron GT (GEN1) with an alternative Adaptive Air Suspension suspension. The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 125 mm, and the maximum is 165 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Audi RS e-tron GT (GEN1). Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as a standard feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes

You can choose between different brake systems. The standard option brakes use regular [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 360mm, and the rear discs are 358mm. The second option brakes use a [cast-iron disc coated with tungsten carbide](../../../../technology/brakes/#carbid-brakes). It doesn't rust and produces hardly any brake dust. The front discs are 410mm, and the rear discs are 365mm. The third option brakes uses [ceramic discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#ceramic-brakes). The front discs are 420mm, and the rear discs are 410mm.

### Regenerative braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**. However, it is not considered full one-pedal driving since, at low speeds, the vehicle will keep rolling until it comes to a stop by itself.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are three levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

The maximum regenerative power is 265 kW.
