## Performance

With overboost, the Audi e-tron GT has a maximum power of 390 KW (530 hp / 476 bhp). Without overboost, it is 350 KW (476 hp / 523 bhp). The torque is 640 nm with overboost and 630 without overboost. It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 4,1 seconds with overboost and 4,5 seconds without overboost. The top speed is 245 km/h.

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 93,4kWh and a net capacity of 83,7kWh, meaning you have a 9,7kWh buffer for protection. (10,4%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) varies from 488 to 448 km (303-278 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range. The consumption is between 17.2kWh/100km for the basic version and 18.7kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 270kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 50 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 18 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 3% to 65%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 165kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 53 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 22kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 10 minutes. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 3% to 58%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 51 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the standard onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 36 minutes. You can also select an optional onboard charger that supports up to 22 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 3 hours and 48 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you park side into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets. A second port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This extra port gives you more parking options for AC charging. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**J1772**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#j1772) for North America and for Europe, [**TYPE2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#type-2). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Audi e-tron GT has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motor(s) used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The Standard suspension has steel springs with a fixed height, but you can adjust damping to fit your driving style or road condition. The ground clearance with this suspension is 145 mm.

You can order Audi e-tron GT with an alternative Adaptive Air Suspension suspension. The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 125 mm, and the maximum is 165 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Audi e-tron GT. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as a standard feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes

You can choose between different brake systems. The standard option brakes use regular [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 360mm, and the rear discs are 358mm. The second option brakes use a [cast-iron disc coated with tungsten carbide](../../../../technology/brakes/#carbid-brakes). It doesn't rust and produces hardly any brake dust. The front discs are 410mm, and the rear discs are 365mm. The third option brakes uses [ceramic discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#ceramic-brakes). The front discs are 420mm, and the rear discs are 410mm.

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in several modes. The most efficient is [automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive). In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking to reduce speed. You can also enable [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). At low speeds, the one-pedal drive mode will keep the car rolling until it stops by itself. You can adjust how strong regen you get when you lift the foot. There are three levels.

## Exterior

You can choose between 54 different paint colors when ordering this model.

You can also choose several styling options to make your car more unique.
 In addition, you can equip this model with an s-line exterior package. This package gives a more sporty design with a sporty diffusor and air intake. 


The black optics design package is an option. This package includes a black single-frame grille, black bezels around the windows, and if equipped with rails, black rails.


Additionally, you can choose between 7 wheels with sizes from 19 to 21 inches.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate).

You can choose between two types of roofs on this model. The standard roof has a large panoramic roof extending from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car's interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.
