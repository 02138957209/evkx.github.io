## Performance

With overboost, the Audi e-tron GT has a maximum power of 390KW (530hp). Without overboost, it is 350KW (476hp). The torque is 640nm with overboost and 630 without overboost. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 4,1 seconds with overboost and 4,5 seconds without overboost. The top speed is 245 kph. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 93,4kWh and a net capacity of 83,7kWh, meaning you have 9,7kWh reserved as a buffer for protection. (10,4%). The range varies based on the equipment trim. Based on the WLTP standard test, the range varies from 488km to 448km, depending on the equipment. The consumption is between 17,2kWh/100km for the basic version and 18,7kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 270kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 50 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 18 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 3% to 65% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 165kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 53 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 22kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 10 minutes to drive. This will requires three charge sessions charging from 3% to 58%. The total time lost for charging will be 51 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the standard onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 36 minutes.
