## Performance

With overboost, the Audi e-tron GT has a maximum power of 390KW (530hp). Without overboost, it is 350KW (476hp). The torque is 640nm with overboost and 630 without overboost. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 4,1 seconds with overboost and 4,5 seconds without overboost. The top speed is 245 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 93,4kWh and a net capacity of 83,7kWh, meaning you have a 9,7kWh buffer for protection. (10,4%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc) The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 488 to 448 km (303-278 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 17,2kWh/100km for the basic version and 18,7kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 270kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 50 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 18 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 3% to 65% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 165kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 53 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 22kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 10 minutes to drive. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 3% to 58%. The total time lost for charging will be 51 minutes.   
### Onboard charger


For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the standard onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 36 minutes. You can also select an optional onboard charger that supports up to 22KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 3 hours and 48 minutes. 

### Charge port

## Drivetrain

Audi e-tron GT has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motor(s) used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/). 

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The Standard suspension has steel springs with a fixed height, but you can adjust damping to fit your driving style or road condition. The ground clearance with this suspension is 145 mm. 

You can order Audi e-tron GT with an alternative Adaptive Air Suspension suspension. The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 125 mm, and the max is 165 mm. 

### Steering

Dynamic steering is standard on the Audi e-tron GT. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is standard. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.  

### Brakes

You can choose between different brake systems. The standard option brakes use regular [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 360mm, and the rear discs are 358mm. The second option brakes use a [cast-iron disc coated with tungsten carbide](../../../../technology/brakes/#carbid-brakes). It doesn't rust and produces hardly any brake dust. The front discs are 410mm, and the rear discs are 365mm. The third option brakes uses [ceramic discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#ceramic-brakes). The front discs are 420mm, and the rear discs are 410mm. 

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in several modes. The most efficient is [automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive). In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking to reduce speed. You can also enable [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). 

## Exterior

You can choose between 54 different paint colors when ordering this model. 

You can also choose several styling options to make your car more unique. 
 In addition, you can equip this model with an s-line exterior package. This package gives a more sporty design with a sporty diffusor and air intake. 

The black optics design package is an option. This package includes a black single-frame grille, black bezels around the windows, and, if equipped with rails, black rails.

Additionally, you can choose between 7 wheels with sizes from 19 to 21 inches. 

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). 

You can choose between two types of roofs on this model. The standard is a panoramic roof.

## Advanced driver assistance systems

The Audi e-tron GT has several standard and optional [advanced driver assistance systems](../../../../technology/driverassistance/)  (ADAS) for better safety and comfort.

[**Efficiency assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/efficencyassist/) is a standard system that helps the driver to drive preemptively and save energy. 
### Safety systems



The Audi e-tron GT has an [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The Audi e-tron GT has an [**Electronic Stability Control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/electronicstabilitycontrol/)  as a standard system designed to improve a vehicle's stability and handling during sudden maneuvers or slippery road conditions. 

The Audi e-tron GT has a [**lane-keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has a [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Front Cross Traffic Assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/frontcrosstrafficassist/) is a optional driver assist system that helps drivers detect oncoming traffic when crossing an intersection or turning left or right from a stopped position. 

[**Rear Cross Traffic Alert**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/rearcrosstrafficalert/) is a optional driver assist system that uses sensors to detect approaching vehicles from the side when backing out of a parking space or driveway. 

[**Forward Collision Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/) is a optional driver assist system to help drivers avoid or mitigate frontal collisions. 

The Audi e-tron GT has an [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/)  as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.

[**Automatic emergency steering**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencysteering/) is a standard  driver assist system designed to help drivers avoid collisions by automatically steering the vehicle in an emergency. 

[**Blind-spot monitoring**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/blindspotmonitoring/) is a optional driver-assist system. This side assist system helps to detect traffic in blind spots. 

### Driving Automation

The Audi e-tron GT offers [driving automation on level 1 or 2](../../../../technology/driverassistance/#level-of-autonomous-driving), depending on the equipment level.

With the   level 1 system, you get the following driving automation features. 
- [**Automatic parking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticparking/). (optional) 


With the Assistantpackage Tour  level 2 system, you get additional driving automation features to the ones listed above. 
- [**Adaptive Cruise control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/adaptivecruisecontrol/) 
- [**Autosteer**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/autosteer/): keeps the car in your lane and slows down if needed in traffic. The system limits how long you can drive without touching the steering wheel.
