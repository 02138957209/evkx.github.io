We have separated our Lexus UX 300e article into sections. If you want to wait to read the full article, click the links below to the different areas. We also have an overview of the [full specifications](specifications/), an [image gallery](gallery/), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve/), and some [online reviews](reviews/).

## Performance

The Lexus UX 300e has a maximum power of 150 KW (204 hp/201 bhp) and a total torque of 300 nm (221 ft-lb). It can sprint from 0 to 100km/h (0 to 62mph) in 7.5 seconds and has a top speed of 160 km/h (99.4 mph).

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 71,4kWh and a net capacity of 64kWh, meaning you have a 7,4kWh buffer for protection. (10.4%).

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) varies from 450 to 440 km (280-274 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range. The consumption is between 14.2kWh/100km for the basic version and 14.5kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 50kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 204 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 90 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 3% to 35%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 34kW. Each charge session would take 36 minutes and 14 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 25kWh/100km, 1000km will take 13 hours and 54 minutes. This trip will require seven charge session(s) charging from 3% to 45%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 334 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 7 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 9 hours and 8 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets. A second port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This extra port gives you more parking options for AC charging. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Lexus UX 300e has a front-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the front axle.

The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 177 mm.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 305mm, and the rear discs are 317mm.

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in several modes. The most efficient is [automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive). In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking to reduce speed. You can also enable [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). At low speeds, the one-pedal drive mode will keep the car rolling until it stops by itself.

## Exterior

You can choose between 10 different paint colors when ordering this model.
Additionally, you can choose between 2 wheels with sizes from 17 to 18 inches.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [hatchback-style liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#hatcback-style-liftgate).

You can choose between two types of roofs on this model. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a panoramic roof. The glass has two panels. One over the first and the second rows. This glass makes the carâ€™s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. Both glass panels have an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

You can order the car with tinted windows from B-pillar and back.
