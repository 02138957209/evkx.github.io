We have separated our Lexus RZ 450e article into sections. If you want to wait to read the full article, click the links below to the different areas. We also have an overview of the [full specifications](specifications), an [image gallery](gallery), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve), and some [online reviews](reviews). Our sections:

## Performance

The Lexus RZ 450e has a maximum power of 230KW (313hp). The total torque is 435nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 5,3 seconds. The top speed is 160 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 71,4kWh and a net capacity of 64kWh, meaning you have a 7,4kWh buffer for protection. (10,4%). 

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 440 to 395 km (273-245 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 14,5kWh/100km for the basic version and 16,2kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 147kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 141 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 34 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 3% to 47% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 88kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 9 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 23kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 14 minutes to drive. This trip will require five charge session(s) charging from 1% to 53%. The total time lost for charging will be 115 minutes.   

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the standard onboard charger supports up to 6,6KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 9 hours and 41 minutes. You can also select an optional onboard charger that supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 5 hours and 49 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger.  The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
