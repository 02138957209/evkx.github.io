## Performance

The Fisker Ocean Extreme has a maximum power of 410KW (557hp). The total torque is nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 3,9 seconds. The top speed is 200 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 102kWh and a net capacity of 100kWh, meaning you have a 2kWh buffer for protection. (2,0%).  The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 707 km (439 mi).   The consumption is 14,1kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 170kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 83 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 39 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 7% to 56% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 109kW. Each charge session would take 27 minutes and 53 seconds. 
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 9 hours and 5 minutes. 

## Drivetrain

Fisker Ocean Extreme has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. 

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has steel springs with a fixed height, but you can adjust damping to fit your driving style or road condition. The ground clearance with this suspension is 175 mm.

### Safety systems



The Fisker Ocean Extreme has a [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The Fisker Ocean Extreme has a [**Electronic Stability Control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/electronicstabilitycontrol/)  as a standard system that is designed to improve the stability and handling of a vehicle during sudden maneuvers or slippery road conditions.

The Fisker Ocean Extreme has a [**lane keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Forward Collision Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/) is a standard driver assist system that is designed to help drivers avoid or mitigate frontal collisions. 

The Fisker Ocean Extreme has a [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/)  as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.

[**Automatic emergency steering**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencysteering/) is a standard  driver assist system designed to help drivers avoid collisions by automatically steering the vehicle in an emergency. 

[**Blind spot monitoring**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/blindspotmonitoring/) is a standard driver assist system. This side assist system helps to detect traffic in blind spots.

### Driving Automation



With the Fisker Intelligent Pilot  level 2 system, you get the following driving automation features. 
- [**Adaptive Cruise control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/adaptivecruisecontrol/) 
- [**Autosteer**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/autosteer/): keeps the car in your lane and slows down if needed in traffic. The system limits how long you can drive without touching the steering wheel. 
- [**Automatic parking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticparking/).
