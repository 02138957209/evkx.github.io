## Performance

With overboost, the Fisker Ocean Extreme has a maximum power of 415KW (564hp). Without overboost, it is 344KW (468hp). The torque is 737nm with overboost and 696 without overboost. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 4 seconds. The top speed is 205 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 113kWh and a net capacity of 106,5kWh, meaning you have a 6,5kWh buffer for protection. (5,8%). The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 707 to 701 km (439-436 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 15,1kWh/100km for the basic version and 15,2kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 170kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 77 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 36 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 2% to 56% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 121kW. Each charge session would take 28 minutes and 28 seconds. 

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 9 hours and 40 minutes. 

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger.  The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Fisker Ocean Extreme has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. 

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has steel springs with a fixed height, but you can adjust damping to fit your driving style or road condition. The ground clearance with this suspension is 165 mm. 

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). 

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in two modes. You can use [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) or you can coast and use the [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal) to regen. 

## Exterior

You can choose between 7 different paint colors when ordering this model. 
Additionally, you can choose between 2 wheels with sizes from 20 to 22 inches. 

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [hatchback-style liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#hatcback-style-liftgate). 

There is only one roof for this model. As an option, you can order this model with a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the carâ€™s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

### Safety systems



The Fisker Ocean Extreme has an [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The Fisker Ocean Extreme has an [**Electronic Stability Control**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/electronicstabilitycontrol/)  as a standard system designed to improve a vehicle's stability and handling during sudden maneuvers or slippery road conditions. 

The Fisker Ocean Extreme has a [**lane-keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has a [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Forward Collision Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/) is a standard driver assist system to help drivers avoid or mitigate frontal collisions. 

The Fisker Ocean Extreme has an [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/)  as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.

[**Automatic emergency steering**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencysteering/) is a standard  driver assist system designed to help drivers avoid collisions by automatically steering the vehicle in an emergency. 

[**Blind-spot monitoring**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/blindspotmonitoring/) is a standard driver-assist system. This side assist system helps to detect traffic in blind spots. 

[**Exit Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/exitwarning/) is a standard  driver assist system designed to warn occupants agains opening doors if there is a risk of hitting something.
