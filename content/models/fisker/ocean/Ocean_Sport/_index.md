We have separated our Fisker Ocean Sport article into sections. If you want to wait to read the full article, click the links below to the different areas. We also have an overview of the [full specifications](specifications/), an [image gallery](gallery/), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve/), and some [online reviews](reviews/). Our sections:

## Performance

With overboost, the Fisker Ocean Sport has a maximum power of 209 KW (284 hp / 245 bhp). Without overboost, it is 180 KW (245 hp / 280 bhp). The torque is 386 nm with overboost and 386 without overboost. It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 7,9 seconds. The top speed is 188 km/h.

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 73kWh and a net capacity of 70kWh, meaning you have a 3kWh buffer for protection. (4,1%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [LFP technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp) This has some benefits and disadvantages from the typical NCA/NCM batteries.

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) is 464 km (288 mi). The consumption is 15.1kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 170kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 47 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 22 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 2% to 64%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 116kW. Each charge session would take 22 minutes and 24 seconds.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 21 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Fisker Ocean Sport has a front-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the front axle.

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 165 mm.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes).

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available through [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal). [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. At low speeds, the one-pedal drive mode will keep the car rolling until it stops by itself. You can adjust how strong regen you get when you lift the foot. There are three levels.

## Exterior

You can choose between 7 different paint colors when ordering this model.
Additionally, you can choose between 2 wheels with sizes from 20 to 22 inches.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [hatchback-style liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#hatcback-style-liftgate).

There is only one roof for this model. As an option, you can order this model with a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the carâ€™s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.
