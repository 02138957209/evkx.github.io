## Performance

With overboost, the Fisker Ocean Ultra reaches a maximum power of 400 kW (544 hp / 536 bhp). Without overboost, it provides a strong 344 kW (468 hp / 461 bhp). The maxium torque is at 737 Nm (544 lb-ft). This powerhouse can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 4.2 seconds and reaches a top speed of 205 km/h (127 mph), showcasing its impressive performance.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 113 kWh and a net usable capacity of 106,5 kWh, providing an 6,5 kWh buffer (5.8%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 380 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 690 km (429 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 15.4 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 170 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 77 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 38 minutes with an average charging speed at 116 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 2% to 46%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 115 kW, with each charging session taking about 24 minutes and 22 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 29 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 56 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 2% to 60%, with a total charging time of 96 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 9 hours and 40 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

Fisker Ocean Ultra features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle.


### Suspension

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The standard suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 165 mm.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes).


### Regenerative braking

[**Automatic regeneration**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. However, [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [**blended brakes**](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal). However, it is not considered full one-pedal driving since, at low speeds, the vehicle will keep rolling until it comes to a stop by itself.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are three levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

## Exterior

The Fisker Ocean Ultra, with dimensions of 4774 mm in length, 1982 mm in width, and 1631 mm in height, falls into the Compact SUVs, also known as C-SUVs, offer a balance between the practicality and maneuverability of smaller vehicles and the space and versatility of larger SUV The Fisker Ocean Ultra is available in a total of 12 paint colors, including several striking metallic options.

You can select from multiple wheel options in different sizes on the Fisker Ocean Ultra, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 255/50 tires on 20" rims
- 255/45 tires on 22" rims

More narrow wheels will improve consumption and give a longer range, while wider wheels will provide better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [hatchback-style liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#hatcback-style-liftgate).

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof has a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.
