## Performance

With overboost, the Fisker Ocean Ultra reaches a maximum power of 400 kW (544 hp / 536 bhp). Without overboost, it provides a strong 344 kW (468 hp / 461 bhp). The maxium torque is at 737 Nm (544 ft-lb). This powerhouse can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 4.2 seconds and reaches a top speed of 205 km/h (127 mph), showcasing its impressive performance.

## Battery, range, and charging

The electric vehicle features a high-capacity battery with a gross capacity of 113 kWh and a net usable capacity of 106,5 kWh, providing an 6,5 kWh buffer (3.6%) for battery protection. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) is 690 km (429 mi). The consumption is 15.4kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 170 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 77 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 38 minutes with an average charging speed at 116 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 2% to 46%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 115 kW, with each charging session taking about 24 minutes and 22 seconds..

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 29kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 56 minutes. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 2% to 60%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 96 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 9 hours and 40 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Fisker Ocean Ultra has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle.

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The standard suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 165 mm.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes).

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available through [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal). [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. At low speeds, the one-pedal drive mode will keep the car rolling until it stops by itself. You can adjust how strong regen you get when you lift the foot. There are three levels.

## Exterior

You can choose between 12 different paint colors when ordering this model.
Additionally, you can choose between 6 wheels with sizes from 20 to 22 inches.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [hatchback-style liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#hatcback-style-liftgate).

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof has a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.
