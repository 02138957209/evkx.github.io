Fisker's first car was the Fisker Karma, which was a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that debuted in 2011. The Karma featured a unique design and advanced technology, but it was plagued by production issues and ultimately failed to gain a foothold in the market.<br /> </br>After a few years of focusing on other ventures, Henrik Fisker returned to the automotive industry in 2016 with the founding of Fisker Inc. The company's second attempt at creating an EV is the Fisker Ocean, an electric SUV that is slated for production in 2023.<br /><br/>The Fisker Ocean features a range of up to 300 miles on a single charge, and it is designed to be both environmentally friendly and affordable. The company has also made sustainability a priority, using recycled materials in the construction of the vehicle and implementing a carbon-neutral manufacturing process.<br /><br/> Fisker Inc. has also announced plans for other EV models, including a pickup truck and a luxury sedan. The company has received significant investment from a variety of sources, including the Canadian auto parts supplier Magna International, and it has stated its ambition to become a leading player in the EV market.
