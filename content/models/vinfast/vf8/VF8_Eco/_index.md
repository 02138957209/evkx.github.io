## Performance

The VinFast VF8 Eco delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 260 kW (354 hp / 349 bhp) and a total torque of 500 Nm (369 lb-ft). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.9 seconds and reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 94 kWh and a net usable capacity of 87,7 kWh, providing an 6,3 kWh buffer (6.7%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 403 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 471 km (293 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 18.6 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 110 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 105 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 44 minutes with an average charging speed at 85 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 11% to 70%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 77 kW, with each charging session taking about 40 minutes and 4 seconds..

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 7 hours and 58 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
