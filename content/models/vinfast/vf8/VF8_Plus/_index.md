## Performance

The VinFast VF8 Plus has a maximum power of 300 KW (408 hp/402 bhp). The total torque is 620 nm (458 ft-lb). It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 5,5 seconds.

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 94kWh and a net capacity of 87,7kWh, meaning you have a 6,3kWh buffer for protection. (6,7%).

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) is 447 km (278 mi). The consumption is 19.6kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 105 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 44 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 11% to 70%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 77kW. Each charge session would take 40 minutes and 4 seconds.
