## Performance

The Volkswagen ID.3 GTX delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 210 kW (286 hp / 282 bhp) and a total torque of 545 Nm (402 lb-ft). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 6 seconds and reaches a top speed of 180 km/h (112 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 82 kWh and a net usable capacity of 79 kWh, providing an 3 kWh buffer (3.7%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 350 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 600 km (373 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 13.2 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 175 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 64 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 35 minutes with an average charging speed at 94 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 2% to 43%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 102 kW, with each charging session taking about 19 minutes and 4 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 21 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 38 minutes. This journey would require four charging stops from 2% to 44%, with a total charging time of 78 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 7 hours and 10 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

Volkswagen ID.3 GTX has a rear-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the rear axle. The motor used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/).


### Suspension

The standard suspension has steel springs with a fixed height but an optional damping adjustment. The ground clearance with this suspension is 150 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is an optional feature on the Volkswagen ID.3 GTX. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed.

### Brakes

The Volkswagen ID.3 GTX uses [disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) in the front for superior stopping power and heat dissipation, while [drum brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#drum-brakes) are employed in the rear for cost efficiency and durability. Drum brakes provide adequate performance for the rear wheels, require less maintenance, and integrate seamlessly with the vehicle's regenerative braking system. This combination ensures optimal braking performance and cost-effectiveness, aligning with the overall efficiency goals of the EV. The front discs are 358mm.


### Regenerative braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**.

## Exterior

The Volkswagen ID.3 GTX, with dimensions of 4261 mm in length, 1809 mm in width, and 1568 mm in height, falls into the C-segment cars, also known as compact cars, strike a balance between size, performance, and affordability, making them versatile for a variety of drivers. The Volkswagen ID.3 GTX is available in a total of 5 paint colors, including both solid and metallic options.

You can select from multiple wheel options in different sizes on the Volkswagen ID.3 GTX, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 215/55 tires on 18" rims
- 215/50 tires on 19" rims
- 215/45 tires on 20" rims

More narrow wheels will improve consumption and give a longer range, while wider wheels will provide better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate).

You can choose between two types of roofs on this model. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a large panoramic roof extending over most of the areas from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted.
