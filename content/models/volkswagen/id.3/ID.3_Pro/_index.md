We have separated our description of Volkswagen ID.3 Pro into sections. If you want to wait to read the full article, click the links below to the different areas. We also have an overview of the [full specifications](specifications), an [image gallery](gallery), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve), and some [online reviews](reviews).

## Performance

The Volkswagen ID.3 Pro has a maximum power of 150KW (204hp). The total torque is 310nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 7,3 seconds. The top speed is 160 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 62kWh and a net capacity of 58kWh, meaning you have a 4kWh buffer for protection. (6,5%). Depending on car options, the [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 427 to 414 km (265-257 mi). Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 13,6kWh/100km for the basic version and 14,0kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 120kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 63 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 34 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 0% to 43% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 77kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 28 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 21kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 19 minutes to drive. This trip will require six charge session(s) charging from 0% to 44%. The total time lost for charging will be 120 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 5 hours and 16 minutes. 

## Drivetrain

Volkswagen ID.3 Pro has a rear-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the rear axle. 

The standard suspension has steel springs with a fixed height but an optional damping adjustment. The ground clearance with this suspension is 150 mm. 

### Steering

Dynamic steering is optional on Volkswagen ID.3 Pro. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. 

### Brakes
