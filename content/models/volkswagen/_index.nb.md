description: "Volkswagen’s product portfolio is focused on electric mobility. The last purely combustion-driven platform will be developed in 2026. After that, only electric vehicles will be developed. Even with today’s current power mix in the EU, battery-powered drive systems offer the best balance for the climate out of all drive concepts and this will continue to improve over the years to come.
