## Performance

The Volkswagen ID.7 GTX Tourer delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 250 kW (340 hp / 335 bhp) and a total torque of 560 Nm (413 lb-ft). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.5 seconds and reaches a top speed of 180 km/h (112 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 91 kWh and a net usable capacity of 86 kWh, providing a 5 kWh buffer (5.5%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 383 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 584 km (363 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 14.7 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 200 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 55 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 29 minutes with an average charging speed at 124 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 3% to 54%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 126 kW, with each charging session taking about 21 minutes and 51 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 21 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 20 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 4% to 53%, with a total charging time of 60 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 7 hours and 49 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Volkswagen ID.7 GTX Tourer features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/) at the front axle and [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/) at the rear axle.

### Suspension

The front suspension employs a [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone) design, while the rear uses a [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink) setup. The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The standard suspension has steel springs with a fixed height but an optional damping adjustment. The ground clearance with this suspension is 149 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is an optional feature on the Volkswagen ID.7 GTX Tourer. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed.

### Brakes

The Volkswagen ID.7 GTX Tourer uses [disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) in the front for superior stopping power and heat dissipation, while [drum brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#drum-brakes) are employed in the rear for cost efficiency and durability. Drum brakes provide adequate performance for the rear wheels, require less maintenance, and integrate seamlessly with the vehicle's regenerative braking system. This combination ensures optimal braking performance and cost-effectiveness, aligning with the overall efficiency goals of the EV. The front discs are 358mm.

### Regenerative Braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**. However, it is not considered full one-pedal driving since, at low speeds, the vehicle will keep rolling until it comes to a stop by itself.

If you lift away the foot completly the regen is at one fixed level. This cant be adjusted.

## Exterior

The Volkswagen ID.7 GTX Tourer, with dimensions of 4961 mm in length, 1862 mm in width, and 1549 mm in height, falls into E-segment cars, also known as executive cars, are larger and more luxurious than their D-segment counterparts. They are designed to offer superior comfort, advanced technology, and high performance, making them suitable for a specific set of drivers. The Volkswagen ID.7 GTX Tourer is available in a total of 7 paint colors, including both solid and metallic options. Some of these paint options include two-tone paints where the roof and upper part of the body are painted in a different color, providing a distinctive and stylish look.

You can select from multiple wheel options in different sizes on the Volkswagen ID.7 GTX Tourer, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 235/50 tires on 19" rims front and 255/45 tires on 19" rims rear
- 235/45 tires on 20" rims front and 255/40 tires on 20" rims rear
- 235/40 tires on 21" rims front and 265/35 tires on 21" rims rear

More narrow wheels will improve consumption and give a longer range, while wider wheels will provide better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate).

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a large panoramic roof extending over most of the areas from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

Additionally, you can order the car with tinted windows from the B-pillar backward, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
