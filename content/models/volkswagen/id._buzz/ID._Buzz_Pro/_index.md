## Performance

The Volkswagen ID. Buzz Pro has a maximum power of 150KW (204hp). The total torque is 310nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 10,2 seconds. The top speed is 145 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 82kWh and a net capacity of 77kWh, meaning you have a 5kWh buffer for protection. (6,1%). The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 418 to 410 km (260-255 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 18,4kWh/100km for the basic version and 18,8kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 135kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 50 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 29 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 0% to 45% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 110kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 52 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 28kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 10 minutes to drive. This trip will require six charge session(s) charging from 0% to 44%. The total time lost for charging will be 111 minutes.   
### Onboard charger



For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 0 minutes.
