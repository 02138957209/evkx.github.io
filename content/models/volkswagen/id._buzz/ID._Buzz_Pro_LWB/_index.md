## Performance

The Volkswagen ID. Buzz Pro LWB has a maximum power of 210KW (286hp). The total torque is 550nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 7,9 seconds. The top speed is 160 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 91kWh and a net capacity of 85kWh, meaning you have a 6kWh buffer for protection. (6,6%). 

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 461 to 452 km (287-281 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 18,4kWh/100km for the basic version and 18,8kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 200kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 55 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 32 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 0% to 42%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss on 113kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 56 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 28kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 3 minutes to drive. This trip will require five charge session(s) charging from 0% to 46%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 104 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 43 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
