## Performance

The Volkswagen ID. Buzz Pro LWB offers modest performance with a maximum power of 210 kW (286 hp / 282 bhp) and a total torque of 550 Nm (406 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 7.9 seconds and has a top speed of 160 km/h (99 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 91 kWh and a net usable capacity of 86 kWh, providing an 5 kWh buffer (5.5%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 350 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 461 to 452 km (287-281 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels, for instance, can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 18.7 kWh/100 km for the base model and 19.0 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 200 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 56 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 33 minutes with an average charging speed at 111 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 0% to 42%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 113 kW, with each charging session taking about 19 minutes and 6 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 28 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 4 minutes. This journey would require six charging stops from 0% to 38%, with a total charging time of 104 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 7 hours and 49 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
