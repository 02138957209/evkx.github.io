## Performance

The Volkswagen ID.4 GTX 4MOTION delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 250 kW (340 hp / 335 bhp) and a total torque of 679 Nm (501 ft-lb). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.5 seconds and reaches a top speed of 180 km/h (112 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 82kWh and a net capacity of 77kWh, meaning you have a 5kWh buffer for protection. (6.1%).

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) is 515 km (320 mi). The consumption is 15.0kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 135kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 62 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 35 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 2% to 43%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 101kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 43 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 22kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 46 minutes. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 2% to 49%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 86 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 0 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
