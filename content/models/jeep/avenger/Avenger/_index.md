We have separated our Jeep Avenger article into sections. If you want to wait to read the full article, click the links below to the different areas. We also have an overview of the [full specifications](specifications), an [image gallery](gallery), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve), and some [online reviews](reviews).

## Performance

The Jeep Avenger has a maximum power of 115KW (156hp). The total torque is 260nm. It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 9 seconds. The top speed is 150 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 54kWh and a net capacity of 50,8kWh, meaning you have a 3,2kWh buffer for protection. (5,9%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc) 

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 404 to 385 km (251-239 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 12.6kWh/100km for the basic version and 13.2kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 100kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 53 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 28 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 2% to 61%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 69kW. Each charge session would take 26 minutes and 10 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 22,0kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 49 minutes. This trip will require six charge session(s) charging from 2% to 58%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 149 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 4 hours and 37 minutes. 

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Jeep Avenger has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. 

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Torsion Beam](../../../../technology/suspension/#torsion-beam). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 200 mm. 

### Brakes



[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in two modes. You can use [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) or you can coast and use the [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal) to regen. 

## Exterior

You can choose between 5 different paint colors when ordering this model. 
Additionally, you can choose between 5 wheels with sizes from 17 to 18 inches. 

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). 

There is only one roof for this model. 

You can order the car with tinted windows from B-pillar and back.
