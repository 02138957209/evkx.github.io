## Performance

The Dacia Spring 65HP kWh provides basic performance with a maximum power of 48 kW (65 hp / 64 bhp) and a total torque of 113 Nm (83 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 13.7 seconds and reaches a top speed of 125 km/h (78 mph), which is more comparable to entry-level traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 26,8 kWh and a net usable capacity of 25 kWh, providing an 1,8 kWh buffer (6.7%) for battery protection. The Lithium-Ion battery uses [LFP technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp) This has some benefits and disadvantages from the typical NCA/NCM batteries.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 220 km (137 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 11.4 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 30 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 80 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 40 minutes with an average charging speed at 26 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 4% to 67%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 25 kW, with each charging session taking about 39 minutes and 30 seconds..

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 7 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 3 hours and 34 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [front](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to park with the front in. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
