Dacia's EV strategy is different from its parent company Renault, which plans to go all-electric in Europe by 2030. Dacia will continue to offer conventional internal-combustion engine models for as long as possible without risking fines from the European Union. Dacia's goal is to keep its costs down and offer the best value for money in the market
