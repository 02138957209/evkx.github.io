## Performance

The Neta GT 580 AWD has a maximum power of 340 KW (462 hp/456 bhp) and a total torque of 620 nm (458 ft-lb). It can sprint from 0 to 100km/h (0 to 62mph) in 3.7 seconds

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 78kWh and a net capacity of 75kWh, meaning you have a 3kWh buffer for protection. (3.8%).

The [CLTC range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/cltc/) is 580 km ( miles). The consumption is 12.9kWh/100km for the CLTC standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 120kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 61 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 31 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 4% to 76%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 90kW. Each charge session would take 36 minutes and 6 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 23kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 3 minutes. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 5% to 74%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 104 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 49 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 150 mm.

### Brakes



[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available through [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) or coasting is not available in this model. You can choose between two stopping modes for one-pedal driving. Hold mode stops the car completely using friction brakes and creep mode will creep the car forward at low speed.

## Exterior

You can choose between 6 different paint colors when ordering this model.



There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof has a large panoramic roof extending from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car's interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.
