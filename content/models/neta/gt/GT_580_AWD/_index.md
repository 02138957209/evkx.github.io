We've divided the article into specific sections for easier navigation. Click the links below to jump to different areas or read on for the full article. We also have an overview of the [full specifications](specifications/), an [image gallery](gallery/), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve/), and some [online reviews](reviews/). Our sections:

## Performance

The Neta GT 580 AWD delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 340 kW (462 hp / 456 bhp) and a total torque of 620 Nm (458 lb-ft). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 3.7 seconds and reaches a top speed of 190 km/h (118 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 78 kWh and a net usable capacity of 75 kWh, providing an 3 kWh buffer (3.8%) for battery protection.

The vehicle's range, according to the [CLTC](../../../../guides/understandingrange/cltc/) (China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle) standard, is 580 km ( miles). he energy consumption is 12.9 kWh/100 km based on the CLTC standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 120 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 61 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 31 minutes with an average charging speed at 102 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 4% to 76%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 90 kW, with each charging session taking about 36 minutes and 6 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 23 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 3 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 5% to 74%, with a total charging time of 104 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 6 hours and 49 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
