We have separated our VOYAH FREE article into sections. If you want to wait to read the full article, click the links below to the different areas. We also have an overview of the [full specifications](specifications/), an [image gallery](gallery/), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve/), and some [online reviews](reviews/). Our sections:

## Performance

The VOYAH FREE has a maximum power of 360 KW (490 hp/483 bhp) and a total torque of 720 nm (531 ft-lb). It can sprint from 0 to 100km/h (0 to 62mph) in 4.4 seconds and has a top speed of 200 km/h (124.3 mph).

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 106kWh and a net capacity of 100kWh, meaning you have a 6kWh buffer for protection. (5.7%).

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) is 500 km (311 mi). The consumption is 20.0kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 100kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 97 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 60 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 15% to 83%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 65kW. Each charge session would take 63 minutes and 34 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 25kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 38 minutes. This trip will require two charge session(s) charging from 10% to 85%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 139 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 9 hours and 5 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

VOYAH FREE has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle.

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 118 mm, and the maximum is 213 mm.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes).

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available through [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) or coasting is not available in this model. At low speeds, the one-pedal drive mode will keep the car rolling until it stops by itself.

## Exterior

You can choose between 6 different paint colors when ordering this model.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate).

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof has a large panoramic extending over most of the areas from the front to the rear. This glass makes the carâ€™s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass has an electrochromic function that lets you blend the glass in multiple levels to protect against the sun.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted.
