## Performance

The Citroën ë-C4 X has a maximum power of 115KW (156hp). The total torque is 260nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 9 seconds. The top speed is 150 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 54kWh and a net capacity of 50,8kWh, meaning you have a 3,2kWh buffer for protection. (5,9%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc) 

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 402 to 396 km (250-246 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 12,6kWh/100km for the basic version and 12,8kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 100kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 53 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 28 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 2% to 61% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 69kW. Each charge session would take 26 minutes and 10 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 19kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 22 minutes to drive. This trip will require five charge session(s) charging from 3% to 58%. The total time lost for charging will be 122 minutes.   

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 4 hours and 37 minutes. 

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This makes it easy for charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Citroën ë-C4 X has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. 

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Torsion Beam](../../../../technology/suspension/#torsion-beam). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 170 mm. 

### Brakes



[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in two modes. You can use [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) or you can coast and use the [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal) to regen. 

## Exterior

You can choose between 5 different paint colors when ordering this model. 
Additionally, you can choose between 5 wheels with sizes from 17 to 18 inches. 

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [boot lid](../../../../technology/doors/#boot-lid) for the trunk. 

There is only one roof for this model. 

You can order the car with tinted windows from B-pillar and back.
