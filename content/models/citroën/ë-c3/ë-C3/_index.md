## Performance

The Citroën ë-C3 has a maximum power of 83KW (113hp). The total torque is nm. It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 11 seconds. The top speed is 135 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 44kWh and a net capacity of 43kWh, meaning you have a 1kWh buffer for protection. (2,3%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [LFP technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp) This has some benefits and disadvantages from the typical NCA/NCM batteries. 

 The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 320 km (199 mi).   The consumption is 13,4kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 100kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 64 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 25 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 13% to 69%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss on 64kW. Each charge session would take 23 minutes and 34 seconds. 

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 3 hours and 54 minutes.
