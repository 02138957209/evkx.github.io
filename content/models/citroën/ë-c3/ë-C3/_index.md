We also have an overview of the [full specifications](specifications/), an [image gallery](gallery/), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve/), and some [online reviews](reviews/).

## Performance

The Citroën ë-C3 kWh provides basic performance with a maximum power of 83 kW (113 hp / 111 bhp) and a total torque of 120 Nm (89 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 11 seconds and reaches a top speed of 135 km/h (84 mph), which is more comparable to entry-level traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 44 kWh and a net usable capacity of 43 kWh, providing an 1 kWh buffer (2.3%) for battery protection. The Lithium-Ion battery uses [LFP technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp) This has some benefits and disadvantages from the typical NCA/NCM batteries.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 320 km (199 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 13.4 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 100 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 64 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 25 minutes with an average charging speed at 73 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 13% to 69%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 64 kW, with each charging session taking about 23 minutes and 34 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 24 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 11 hours and 25 minutes. This journey would require nine charging stops from 15% to 66%, with a total charging time of 186 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 3 hours and 54 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
