## Performance

The Aion Hyper GT 710 Supercharged delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 250 kW (340 hp / 335 bhp) and a total torque of 430 Nm (317 ft-lb). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 4.9 seconds and reaches a top speed of 257 km/h (160 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The electric vehicle features a high-capacity battery with a gross capacity of 80,1 kWh and a net usable capacity of 77 kWh, providing an 3,1 kWh buffer (3.6%) for battery protection.

The [CLTC range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/cltc/) is 710 km ( miles). The consumption is 10.8kWh/100km for the CLTC standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 270 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 38 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 20 minutes with an average charging speed at 159 kW. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 2% to 54%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 152kW. Each charge session would take 16 minutes and 50 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 20kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 9 minutes. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 2% to 56%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 49 minutes.
