## Performance

The Zeekr 001 Privilege AWD has a maximum power of 400KW (544hp). The total torque is 686nm. It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 3,8 seconds. The top speed is 200 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 100kWh and a net capacity of 95kWh, meaning you have a 5kWh buffer for protection. (5,0%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc) 

 The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 580 km (360 mi).   The consumption is 16.4kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 200kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 57 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 27 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 4% to 58%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 134kW. Each charge session would take 23 minutes and 54 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 28kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 43 minutes. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 5% to 54%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 83 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 8 hours and 38 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 162 mm, and the maximum is 192 mm. 

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 533mm, and the rear discs are 457mm. 

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available through [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal). [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. 

## Exterior

You can choose between 4 different paint colors when ordering this model. 

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [hatchback-style liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#hatcback-style-liftgate). 

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof has a large panoramic roof extending over most areas from the front to the rear. This glass makes the carâ€™s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted.
