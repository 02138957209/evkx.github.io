## Performance

The Zeekr 001 Performance AWD has a maximum power of 400KW (544hp). The total torque is 910nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 3,8 seconds. The top speed is 210 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 100kWh and a net capacity of 95kWh, meaning you have a 5kWh buffer for protection. (5,0%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)  The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 590 km (367 mi).   The consumption is 16,1kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 200kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 61 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 29 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 4% to 55% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 133kW. Each charge session would take 22 minutes and 52 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 28kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 44 minutes to drive. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 5% to 54%. The total time lost for charging will be 84 minutes.   

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 8 hours and 38 minutes. 

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This makes it easy for charge stations where you need to back up in to the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Zeekr 001 Performance AWD has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. 

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 194 mm, and the max is 194 mm. 

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 400mm, and the rear discs are 390mm. 

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available through [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal). [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive)r coasting is not available in this model. 

## Exterior

You can choose between 4 different paint colors when ordering this model. 

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [hatchback style liftegate](../../../../technology/doors/#hatcback-style-liftgate). 

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof has a large panoramic roof extending over most areas from the front to the rear. This glass makes the carâ€™s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted.
