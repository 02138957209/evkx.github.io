## Performance

The Zeekr 001 FR delivers a jaw-dropping maximum power of 930 KW (1264 hp/1247 bhp) and a massive total torque of 1200 Nm (886 lb-ft). This powerhouse can rocket from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 2.02 seconds, showcasing its astonishing acceleration. Additionally, it achieves a top speed of 280 km/h (174 mph), making it a true marvel of engineering and performance.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 100 kWh and a net usable capacity of 95 kWh, providing an 5 kWh buffer (5.0%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 370 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 580 km (361 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 16.4 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 200 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 57 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 27 minutes with an average charging speed at 147 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 4% to 58%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 134 kW, with each charging session taking about 23 minutes and 54 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 28 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 43 minutes. This journey would require four charging stops from 5% to 54%, with a total charging time of 83 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 8 hours and 38 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
