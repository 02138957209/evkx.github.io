## Performance

The Zeekr 001 Long Range RWD has a maximum power of 200KW (272hp). The total torque is 343nm. It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 7,2 seconds. The top speed is 200 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 100kWh and a net capacity of 95kWh, meaning you have a 5kWh buffer for protection. (5,0%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc) 

 The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 590 km (367 mi).   The consumption is 16.1kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 200kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 61 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 29 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 4% to 55%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 133kW. Each charge session would take 22 minutes and 52 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 28kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 44 minutes. This trip will require four charge session(s) charging from 5% to 54%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 84 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 8 hours and 38 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

[Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. 

## Exterior

You can choose between 4 different paint colors when ordering this model. 

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [hatchback-style liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#hatcback-style-liftgate). 

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof has a large panoramic roof extending over most areas from the front to the rear. This glass makes the carâ€™s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted.
