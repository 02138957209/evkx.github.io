We have separated our Zeekr X Privilege AWD article into sections. If you want to wait to read the full article, click the links below to the different areas. We also have an overview of the [full specifications](specifications), an [image gallery](gallery), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve), and some [online reviews](reviews).

## Performance

The Zeekr X Privilege AWD has a maximum power of 315KW (428hp). The total torque is 543nm. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) takes 3,8 seconds. The top speed is 180 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 69kWh and a net capacity of 64kWh, meaning you have a 5kWh buffer for protection. (7,2%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)  The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) is 400 km (249 mi).   The consumption is 16,0kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 150kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 82 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 31 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 5% to 54% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 90kW. Each charge session would take 21 minutes and 58 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 26kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 32 minutes to drive. This trip will require seven charge session(s) charging from 5% to 49%. The total time lost for charging will be 132 minutes.   

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 22KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 2 hours and 54 minutes. 

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This makes it easy for charge stations where you need to back up in to the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.
