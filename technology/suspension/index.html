They can be made of steel coils, air bags, or other materials.</p></li><li><p><em>Shock absorbers or dampers:</em> These are designed to reduce the oscillations caused by the springs by dissipating the energy stored in the springs. They also help to maintain tire contact with the road surface by controlling the rebound and compression of the springs.</p></li><li><p><em>Control arms:</em> These are typically made of steel and connect the wheel hub assembly to the vehicle&rsquo;s chassis or subframe. They help to control the wheel&rsquo;s movement while allowing for some degree of lateral and longitudinal movement.</p></li><li><p><em>Sway bar or stabilizer bar:</em> This component is designed to minimize body roll and improve stability during cornering by connecting the left and right wheels together.</p></li><li><p><em>Struts:</em> These are similar to shock absorbers but also serve to support the weight of the vehicle. They are commonly used in MacPherson strut suspension systems.</p></li><li><p><em>Bushings:</em> These are small rubber or polyurethane components that are used to isolate and dampen vibrations and noise between different components of the suspension system.</p></li></ul><p>Overall, the suspension system is a complex assembly of components that work together to provide a smooth and comfortable ride while maintaining stability, control, and safety.</p><figure><div class=pswp-gallery id=gallery--b823583a87f159463844badcec1261f4><a href=https://media.evkx.net/multimedia/technology/suspension/bilstein.jpg data-pswp-width=1451 data-pswp-height=1200 target=_blank><img src=https://media.evkx.net/multimedia/technology/suspension/bilstein_st.jpg alt="Bilstein dampers and springs" title="Bilstein dampers and springs" width=800 height=661 class=img-fluid target=_blank></a></div><figcaption><p class="lead text-center fw-semibold">Bilstein dampers and springs</p></figcaption></figure><script type=module>

  </script><h3 id=leaf-suspension>Leaf Suspension</h3><p>Leaf suspension is a type of suspension system used in cars, trucks, and trailers, which uses a series of curved metal plates called leaf springs. The leaf springs are mounted on the vehicle&rsquo;s frame and axles, and they work together to provide a smooth ride and support the weight of the vehicle.</p><p>The way leaf suspension works is that the leaf springs are arranged in a stack, with the longest leaf at the bottom and progressively shorter leaves stacked on top. The leaves are clamped together with a center bolt and held in place with metal clips. When the vehicle hits a bump or uneven road surface, the leaf springs compress and absorb the shock, allowing the wheels to move up and down independently of the vehicle&rsquo;s frame.</p><p>Some of the advantages of leaf suspension include:</p><p>High weight capacity: Leaf suspension is capable of supporting a high weight capacity, making it ideal for use in heavy-duty trucks and trailers.</p><p>Simple design: Leaf suspension has a simple design with fewer components, which makes it less expensive to manufacture and repair.</p><p>Good durability: Leaf suspension is durable and can withstand heavy loads and rough terrain.</p><p>Some of the disadvantages of leaf suspension include:</p><p>Stiff ride: Leaf suspension can provide a stiff ride compared to other types of suspension systems, which can be uncomfortable for passengers.</p><p>Limited adjustability: Leaf suspension is not as adjustable as other types of suspension systems, which can make it difficult to fine-tune the suspension for optimal performance.</p><p>Poor handling: Leaf suspension can cause the vehicle to bounce and sway on rough roads, which can affect the vehicle&rsquo;s handling and stability.</p><p>Noise and vibration: Leaf suspension can produce noise and vibration when driving, which can be unpleasant for passengers.</p><h2 id=air-suspension>Air suspension</h2><p>Air suspension is a type of vehicle suspension system that uses compressed air to provide support and cushioning. It consists of airbags, a compressor, and a control system that regulates the amount of air in the bags to adjust the height and stiffness of the suspension. This replaces the spring in conventional systems.</p><p>When the vehicle is in motion, the air compressor pumps compressed air into the airbags to maintain a consistent ride height and cushion the vehicle from bumps and vibrations. The control system uses sensors to detect changes in the road and adjusts the air pressure in the bags to maintain a smooth ride.</p><p>One of the primary advantages of air suspension is that it provides a more comfortable ride than traditional suspension systems. It can also be adjusted to accommodate different loads and road conditions, making it ideal for vehicles that carry heavy loads or operate on rough terrain.</p><p>Another advantage is that air suspension can help improve handling and stability by lowering the center of gravity of the vehicle. It can also help reduce wear and tear on tires and other suspension components.</p><p>However, there are some potential drawbacks to air suspension. It can be more expensive to repair or replace than traditional suspension systems. It can also be more complex, with more components that can fail or malfunction.</p><p>Additionally, some drivers may prefer the feel of a traditional suspension system, which can be more responsive and provide a better &ldquo;road feel.&rdquo; Finally, the compressor that powers the air suspension system can consume more energy than a traditional system, which can result in lower fuel efficiency.</p><p>Some models only use the air suspension to adjust for different loads, trying to keep the ride height at the same level. These models typically only have air suspension at the rear axle. Examples are the Mercedes EQC and BMW I4.</p><figure><div class=pswp-gallery id=gallery--fa937c139ad1ee22db8520ff50185890><a href=https://media.evkx.net/multimedia/technology/suspension/wishboneairsuspensionfront.jpg data-pswp-width=3000 data-pswp-height=2077 target=_blank><img src=https://media.evkx.net/multimedia/technology/suspension/wishboneairsuspensionfront_st.jpg alt="Front Air Suspension" title="Front Air Suspension" width=800 height=553 class=img-fluid target=_blank></a></div><figcaption><p class="lead text-center fw-semibold">Front Air Suspension</p></figcaption></figure><script type=module>

  </script><h2 id=adaptive-damping>Adaptive damping</h2><p>Adaptive damping suspension is a technology that adjusts the damping of a car&rsquo;s suspension system in real-time based on the driving conditions and the driver&rsquo;s preferences. The damping of a suspension system determines how much the suspension compresses and rebounds when the car encounters bumps and rough road surfaces.</p><p>In an adaptive damping suspension system, sensors are used to detect the motion of the car, including its speed, acceleration, and the state of the road surface. This information is then used by a computer to adjust the damping of the suspension system in real-time. The computer can also take into account the driver&rsquo;s preferences, such as a sporty or comfortable driving style.</p><p>There are several different types of adaptive damping suspension systems, but they all aim to provide a smoother, more comfortable ride while also improving the car&rsquo;s handling and stability. Some systems use magnetic fluid in the shock absorbers to adjust the damping, while others use electronic solenoids to control the flow of hydraulic fluid.</p><p>Overall, adaptive damping suspension can improve the driving experience by providing a more comfortable ride and better handling, especially on uneven or bumpy roads.</p><figure><div class=pswp-gallery id=gallery--2673c979f07a8d2c3e9156c735c629da><a href=https://media.evkx.net/multimedia/technology/suspension/rsetrongtsuspension.jpg data-pswp-width=3000 data-pswp-height=1723 target=_blank><img src=https://media.evkx.net/multimedia/technology/suspension/rsetrongtsuspension_st.jpg alt="Audi RS e-tron GT adaptive air suspension" title="Audi RS e-tron GT adaptive air suspension" width=800 height=459 class=img-fluid target=_blank></a></div><figcaption><p class="lead text-center fw-semibold">Audi RS e-tron GT adaptive air suspension</p></figcaption></figure><script type=module>
