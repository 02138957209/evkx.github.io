The production of real leather involves the use of chemicals, water, and energy, which can have a significant impact on the environment.</p><p>However, the production of leatherette also involves the use of chemicals, which can be harmful to the environment if not disposed of properly. In addition, the synthetic materials used to make leatherette are derived from non-renewable resources, which can contribute to environmental degradation.</p><p>In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards eco-friendly leatherette. Some manufacturers are using recycled materials to produce leatherette, while others are using biodegradable materials that can be composted at the end of their life cycle. These eco-friendly options are designed to reduce the environmental impact of leatherette and provide a more sustainable option for consumers.</p><h2 id=microfiber>Microfiber</h2><figure><div class=pswp-gallery id=gallery--4aa5bfce14506304688e3a63f5d6e787><a href=https://media.evkx.net/multimedia/technology/seats/materials/porschetaycanracetext_1.jpg data-pswp-width=3000 data-pswp-height=2000 target=_blank><img src=https://media.evkx.net/multimedia/technology/seats/materials/porschetaycanracetext_1_st.jpg alt="Porsche Taycan seats with Race-Tex microfiber" title="Porsche Taycan seats with Race-Tex microfiber" width=800 height=533 class=img-fluid target=_blank></a></div><figcaption><p class="lead text-center fw-semibold">Porsche Taycan seats with Race-Tex microfiber</p></figcaption></figure><script type=module>
