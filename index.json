The torque is 664nm with overboost and 561 without overboost. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 5,7 seconds with overboost and 6,6 seconds without overboost. The top speed is 200 kph.\nBattery, range, and charging The battery has a gross capacity of 95kWh and a net capacity of 86,5kWh, meaning you have 8,5kWh reserved as a buffer for protection. (8,9%). The range varies based on the equipment trim. Based on the WLTP standard test, the range varies from 441km to 369km, depending on the equipment. The consumption is between 19,6kWh/100km for the basic version and 23,4kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test.\nThe maximum DC charging speed is 150kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 45 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 26 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 3% to 81% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 118kW. Each charge session would take 34 minutes and 24 seconds.\nFor the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 27kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 54 minutes to drive.

EVKX.net have all the details.","content":" Porsche Taycan Performance With overboost, the Porsche Taycan has a maximum power of 300KW (408hp). Without overboost, it is 240KW (326hp). The torque is 345nm with overboost and without overboost. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 5,4 seconds. The top speed is 230 kph.\nWith the optional Performance Battery Plus battery, you get other performance numbers. With overboost, the Porsche Taycan has a maximum power of 350KW (476hp). Without overboost, it is 280KW (381hp). The torque is 357nm with overboost and without overboost. The 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) is performed in 5,4 seconds. The top speed is 230 kph.\nBattery, range, and charging Porsche Taycan has two battery options with different specifications. Below you see how this affects range and charging.\nPerformance Battery The battery has a gross capacity of 79,2kWh and a net capacity of 71kWh, meaning you have 8,2kWh reserved as a buffer for protection. (10,4%). The range varies based on the equipment trim. Based on the WLTP standard test, the range varies from 431km to 354km, depending on the equipment. The consumption is between 16,5kWh/100km for the basic version and 20,1kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test.\nThe maximum DC charging speed is 225kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 45 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 19 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 0% to 67% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 136kW. Each charge session would take 21 minutes and 2 seconds.\nFor the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 22kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 26 minutes to drive. This will requires three charge sessions charging from 0% to 70%. The total time lost for charging will be 66 minutes.\nPerformance Battery Plus The battery has a gross capacity of 93,4kWh and a net capacity of 83,7kWh, meaning you have 9,7kWh reserved as a buffer for protection. (10,4%). The range varies based on the equipment trim. Based on the WLTP standard test, the range varies from 484km to 407km, depending on the equipment. The consumption is between 16,5kWh/100km for the basic version and 20,1kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test.\nThe maximum DC charging speed is 270kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 50 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 18 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 3% to 65% resulting in an actual charge speed including time loss on 165kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 53 seconds.\nFor the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 22kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 10 minutes to drive. This will requires three charge sessions charging from 3% to 58%. The total time lost for charging will be 51 minutes.\nOnboard charger For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the standard onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 6 hours and 27 minutes. You can also select an optional onboard charger that supports up to 22KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 3 hours and 13 minutes.\nDrivetrain Porsche Taycan has a rear-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the rear axle.\nThe Standard suspension has steel springs with a fixed height, but you can adjust damping to fit your driving style or road condition.
